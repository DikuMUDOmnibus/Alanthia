#2  When a low level dwarf is drunk, some mobs (guards in amber palace) hit
him for negative damage, and it actually heals them.  Don't know if this
happens for other lvls or mobs or races.

#3  Forgot to include that a player can rescue a thief/assassin, and the
thief/assassin can backstab the mob.  No one does this though.  Barely anyone
groups.

#4  Mobs show up as someones if mob is hidden (invis?), if time is night, and
if player has detect spells on.  Happens a lot in rainforest area.  I'm pretty
sure this applies to players as being someones also under these conditions.
If player does not have detect spells, mob is hidden, and time is night, the
mob then shows its name when attacking.

#5  Mobs do lesser damage when equiped with a weapon, at least for high lvls.
Mobs like the onyx dragons in Z'tari Tomb are an example.
