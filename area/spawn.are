A Reeking Gorge~
Like a jagged wound cut into the flesh of the earth, the ground falls
away here, as though some primordial titan stabbed the earth with its
trident in wrath.  From the deeps below rises a thin mist, pale yellow in
colour, reeking of fungus, of rot, and of the uncounted years this place has
decayed, far from the sight of the world.  A pale white boulder stands out
from the rest of the terrain, both by its colour and its soft roundness.  On
its side, in letters the size of a minotaur, you can just make out an
inscription.  At your feet, a crumbling stair with steps six feet high picks
its way down the canyon wall.

The Gate~
Before you lies the spectacular remains of a mammoth gate of stone,
banded with iron.  Some 70 feet tall, the titan doors were obviously meant
to last for eternity and protect from all comers.  But now the gates lay
twisted on their adamant hinges, nearly ripped from the cliffside they bar
by some vast force, a sickly yellow mist flowing thickly from the darkness
within.  They were meant to guard forever from any threat the world could
bring.  But not all dangers come from outside..

Empty.  That is the best word to describe the room you stand in.  With a
ceiling over fifty feet high and walls twice that far apart, the room's
emptiness exudes a near-palpable menace.  The walls are lined with large
globes of violet crystal, bathing you in an eerie light that makes parts of

the floor is some rubble from the collapsed wall, and a few spears with odd

The walls of this chamber are irregularly shaped, like a cave washed out
by water for thousands of years.  The floor, however, is perfectly flat,
half of its area taken up by an enormous pentagram, surrounded by strange
writing and oddly warped circles.  Beyond the pentagram on the far side of
the chamber is a large gate built directly into the floor, covered with a

A vast hall spreads out into the darkness before you.  Massive pillars of
black stone, taller and greater than the mightiest trees of Alanthia, line
the hall as far as the eye can see.  The floor, made of blocks of dark
masonry, is covered with slippery fungal growths, fed by the constant drips
of water from the high ceiling.  Almost hidden by the constant drip are
voices, soft and gentle as a feather, whispering amongst themselves of
horrid things.  {W"Hastur.....  Ord of the Wells..  Let them be... 
Tsathoggua....  E well of night..  Fleshy ones...  Not our concern....  Our

twisted faces of stone, but as still as the rock which spawned them.

Fountain Room~
At the center of this once-opulent room stands a simple fountain of
stone, now dry.  However, the floor is covered with a steadily-flowing
current of dark water which creeps from cracks in the northern wall, and
seeps away again in the south.  Floating in the current you catch a glimpse
of a few bloated maggots, swollen and drowned.  The crystal globes in this
room have long since been smashed.

metal, and you see reflections of yourself cascading everywhere you look,

Shattered Altar~
A huge altarstone dominates the center of the room, the only thing that
has been spared destruction here.  A towering set of statues at the southern
end of the room have been toppled and defaced, carvings on pillars have been
hacked with blades, and a river has eroded its way through the northern
wall, the foul water spilling over the floor and disappearing through large
cracks at the opposite side of the chamber.  Embedded in the floor just
beside the intruding water lays a stained metal plaque.

altarstone~
It is some twenty feet high and over eighty feet across, a mammoth
obsidian altar carved to resemble a disembodied mouth screaming curses to

which empty into copper pots at each corner, where the blood of sacrifices
was likely collected for some unknown and horrible purpose.

If these are the gods of the builders of this structure, they long ago

Faces of the Enemy~
Everything is looking at you.  The walls, the floor, the ceiling..  The
entire room has been constructed, by some magic the likes of which are only
whispered, of living faces.  Humans, dwarves, ogres, dragons, goblins, faces
of all the races of Alanthia and many you cannot recognize, some unholy
magic has torn away the heads of thousands of living things and created this
place with them.  A howling rips at your ears, the voices of all of the
creatures trapped here, screaming at you, some in hatred, some pleading,
others simply mad from the untold stretches of time spent imprisoned.

Conjuring Room~
The floor disappears beneath your feet, but you do not fall.  Somehow,
here, far beneath the earth, the stars have come out.  All around you, above
and below, ten thousand pinpoints of light dot the midnight sky.  Brightest
of all the constellations in the surrounding dark is one directly below you,
a perfectly formed pentagram.  Intermittently, streaks of purple lightning
flash around the edge of the magical star-symbol.

Hall of Heroes~
Over one hundred statues line this massive hall, their eighty-foot
heights forged from some variety of bluish metal which has remained unharmed
and unstained all these years.  A silvery path cuts its way through the
center of the room into another hall in the north.  The crystal globes that
light the rest of the structure have been replaced with odd torches, which
seem to burn with an almost ethereal silver fire.

statues~
Perhaps these were the heroes of this ancient land.  They certainly are

scholars, and workers of magic.  Curiously there are no statues of priests. 
Maybe the gods of this dead race communicated directly with them, not
needing the services of priests to spread their word.

Hall of the Vanquished~
Some thirty statues are scattered randomly through this hall.  They seem
to have been formed with perfect detail, right down to the skin tone and the
moistness of their eyes....  Eyes which seem to follow you as you move. 
They appear to be depictions of the former occupants of these lands.  In the
western wall, the stone has been shattered, carving out a rough cavern. 
Hanging high above in mid-air, with no visible means of support, is a
warning written in flame.  {R"Yith And Jotunheim Fell Before Us, As Did

Examining more carefully, you see that these cannot be statues, unless

despair in their eyes, the only thing about them which moves.

Last Stand~
Bones fill this rough cavern which has been brutally torn from the rock. 
The lives of hundreds must have ended here in horrific fashion.  Most of the
massive skeletons are incomplete, as if ripped limb from limb, and some are
simply shattered.  The far western wall has been melted and many bones are
stuck inside the now-frozen rock.  A powerful odour of fungus permeates the
air.

Portal Room~
The floor of this room is completely awash with foul-smelling water which
floods in from a hole in the eastern wall.  To the north, three huge hoops
of stone stand free on pedestals, flickers of old magic spitting off them. 
Images flash inside the portals irregularly, scenes of distant lands and
ruined cities.  A rickety staircase of wood seems to have been constructed
within the last few hundred years, leading up to a small hole in the wall.

hoops to the wall behind.
