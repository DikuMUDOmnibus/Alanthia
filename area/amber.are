Georgina~
An assassin that failed sits here, trying to kill herself with her own chains.
~
Georgina is perhaps one of the most inept assassins every born. 
Attempting to poison the King, she instead mistakenly poisoned the Royal
cat.  In an attempt to save its life by walking it around until the poison
wore off, she walked it to death, dragging it along by its leash for ten
miles in a circle until it choked to death.  If anything, she deserves to be
here for pure stupidity.

rare and valuable jewels.  A shining sceptre is placed inbetween the two
thrones, glittering with a cornucopia of light from the jewels set into the
pommel.  Heavy banners and tapestries line the translucent walls and
overhead a large stained glass skylight has been set into the amber ceiling,
depicting the Royal Crest of the Amber Palace Royalty.  Large gold braziers
filled with rare incense are burning in the corners of the room and a white
marble fountain is spouting water in the center.  A trio of white snow
leopards are chained and leashed to the fountains, snarling hungrily at you.

The Kitchen~
You have entered the kitchen of Amber Palace.  This large room is
absolutely full of varying pots and pans of all sorts.  The sudden flash of
fire startles you for a second before you realize it is only a cooking fire,
flaring from the grease of a spit pig.  The room is alive with smell and the
bustling of busy chefs, preparing a meal for the Royal Family.  There is a
door north and the way to the feasting hall is south.

You are in the Grand Ballroom.  The floor here is a polished amber
surface and large clear windows are placed along the south wall.  Brilliant
flaming lamps light the room and a small area near the east wall is filled
with chairs for the musicians.  A large painting of the Royal Family is set
in the west wall and the room is filled with the very atmosphere of
elegance.

The Guest Corridor~
You are in a corridor leading the the guest rooms.  Doors line the
hallway to the north and south, and various lanterns and braziers of flame
have been left here so the guests of the Royal Family may find their way in
safety.  A few elegant tapestries lines the walls inbetween the doors and a
current of cool air blows slowly by you, indication of a ventilation conduit
of some sort.

You are in what appears to be the dining hall of the servants.  Nowhere
as stunning as the feasting hall, this room is not exactly shabby.  The
decor here is plain and simple, everything seeming to have a purpose of
usefullness rather than that of ornamentation.  The large wooden table seats
about forty people, but is made of a sturdy unfinished wood.  The lighting
of the room comes from a few open windows and a singe large copper brazier
in the middle of the table.  Simple stone plates and wooden mugs are set up
on the table, a bucket of water and some rags in the corner, ready to clean
up any messes made.

generally abject and dismal mood fills this chamber, matching the grayish
lightning perfectly.  A few squeaks of vermin remind you that you are not
alone here.  The cells are to the south, the way back up is right above you.

The Secret Passageway~
You are in a secret passageway high in Amber Palace.  It is very dark
here, and you are not sure quite where you are.  A few flickering torches
give out just enough light so that you may barely keep from falling upon you
own feet.  You stumble along the corridor, hoping nobody sees you here.

You are walking in the dark corridors deep within Amber Palace.  Nothing
is visible here, just blankets of darkness.  As you stumble along, you
wonder what may be ahead of you.  You have heard many tales of grisly traps
and psychotic guards hidden here, and shudder as you hear the sound of a
sword being drawn in the darkness.

embroidered clothes stands next to it.  A large platinum brazier burns
incense both for a fragrant aroma as well as for light.  You wonder who
could be important enough to book a room in the Royal Chambers, so secret

The Magician's Chambers~
You have discovered the chambers of the court's magician.  This chamber
is a total and utter mess.  Various beakers and vials lay strewn about the
floor and tables, spilling multi-colored fluids everywhere.  Star charts and
land mass maps are pinned to the walls, and pentagrams of every sort are
scrawled about.  Piles upon piles of books and large tomes are heaped
against the shelves, which look as if they are about to break under the
weight.  Jars of strange objects and dried animals are placed in the
northwest corner, and bags of herbs are heaped in the northeast corner.  It
is obvious that the palace maids never come up here.

You are in the court magician's bedchamber.  Perhaps you should go back
outside to his main chamber.  It is at least neater outside.  The large bed
is completely covered with strange object that you can not even begin to
fathom the uses for.  Scrolls and parchments litter the floor so thoroughly
that you cannot take a single step without crushing something.  Dusty
amulets and talismans are hanging from hooks set into the walls everywhere. 
A strange bluish flame burns in the middle of the room, coming from no
apparant source.

backpack and begin to stuff it full.

The King's Love Chambers~
You have found the secret chambers of the King's mistresses.  The room is
filled with plush silk pillows, large beds, tapestries of every sort, and a
larder stocked with food and wine.  Girls of every size, color, and race are
sprawled about, winking coquettishly as you draw near.  An exotic incense is
burning in the corner, next to an array of massage oils.

The Path to the Gardens~
You are on a peaceful dirt path to the Royal Gardens.  The path is
trimmed with amber rocks and slender willow trees.  The air here is cool and
fresh, the sounds of birds singing fills your ears.  The occasional squirrel
streaks past you, stopping for a moment to chew upon an acorn.

The Royal Gardens~
You are walking in the Royal Gardens.  Rare plants bloom here and the
very air is filled with herbal and sweet scents.  Strange yet colorful
bushes sprout from every corner, and odd trees grow about you.  Ferns and
vines mix together, and strange water lilies grow in the small lake that
sits serenely in the middle of the gardens.  The frogs croak loudly, adding
their voices to that of the birds and the dragonflies buzz incessantly here.
The whole garden maintains an aura of peaceful harmony and you feel at ease
here.

war.  There is a long glass table here and maps of every country and area in
the world are tacked up against the walls.  Books of strategy are shelved
neatly against the wall to the north, and a set of red marking pencils are
in a jar atop the books.  A large slate board is against the south wall, a
container of colored chalks next to it.  It seems the King takes warring
very seriously.

the chambers themselves are two totally different tasks.  The corridors are
filled with darkness and you have no idea what traps or guards may lay in
wait for you.  Perhaps you should leave now.

The Dark Corridor~
You are walking in the dark corridors deep within Amber Palace.  Nothing
is visible here, just blankets of darkness.  As you stumble along, you
wonder what may be ahead of you.  You have heard many tales of grisly traps
and psychotic guards hidden here, and shudder as you hear the sound of a
sword being drawn in the darkness.
