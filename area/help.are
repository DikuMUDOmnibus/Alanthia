-1 harassment~

{RHARASSMENT{X
 
{RHarassment{c is not tolerated in Alanthia.  Harassment comes in many forms --
verbal, physical, and sexual.  Harassment is generally defined as unwanted
attention or behavior that occurs consistently over time.
 
Sexual harassment is the most despicable form of harassment:
Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (United States).
 
Unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or
physical conduct of sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when
submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects
an individual's status, unreasonably interferes with an individual's
performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.
 
 
  {R* {cThe victim as well as the harasser may be a woman or a man.  The victim
    does not have to be of the opposite sex.
 
  {R* {cThe victim does not have to be the person harassed but could be anyone
    affected by the offensive conduct.
 
  {R* {cThe harasser's conduct must be unwelcome.
 
It is helpful for the victim to directly inform the harasser that the conduct
is unwelcome and must stop.
 
If you are a victim of harassment, inform Wysparthuul, Halodar, or
Fuitentooty with a tell or a personal note.  Your name will not be mentioned
throughout the investigation and after the investigation.{x

{RPOWERLEVELING
 
Powerleveling{c is not allowed on this mud.
 
Powerleveling is the weakening of mobs by one player so another player can
easily kill them for the experience.  If these players are grouped and share
the experience from the kill, then it is not powerleveling.
 
Some examples of powerleveling include:
 
  {R* {cSpelling down mobs
  {R* {cSpelling up players during fights
  {R* {cHealing players during fights
  {R* {cKilling mobs that assist to make the other mobs easier to kill
 
All parties involved will be punished.  So don't do it.{x

{RT{rhe moons of Alanthia have  risen  and  returned  to their
slumbers many of times.    Good and Evil have been totally
obliterated from the lands, leaving nothing behind but the
uncaring neutrality of {gR{Wo{gm{Wa{gn{Wa{r.
 
{RT{rhe shadows slowly crept along by the  admittance of a new
creature into the lands of Alanthia,   a new kind of evil,
not so unlike that  of  a  bounty  hunter.  In the path of
blood from his latest victim, Blanx, of  the dragon brood,
ventured out into the lands.   Confused as  to  where  his
game had brought him, he  quickly  pierced  the  necks  of
those that stood before him, draining it of it's  precious
life force.  With his  strenght  replenished, he began his
dumbfounded tour of this new world. He quickly learned all
was well, and at peace, and quickly decided to rectify the
matter.  He stalked and hunted with the shadows and placed
bounties on the heads of the mighty natives that remained,
removing the heads himself  whenever  possible.   For many
weeks to come,  the  shadows  seemed  to begin to flourish
with the blood from many elves, and Blanx caught a glimpse
quickly led upon a pair of hunting Drow: Gikk and Malachi.
Both of them  assassins by  their blade,  yet  warriors by
heart.  They offered to teach him the  lands  of  Alanthia
better than he could have  learned  them  on  his  own, in
return for his protection.   The trio quickly grew strong,
and began doing what they knew best. To raise utter chaos.
The casualties began to climb faster  than any  could keep
track. They often sat and pondered if what they were doing
was right,  only to discover that they held little concern
for right or wrong.
 
{RB{rlanx, Gikk, and Malachi.  Three  beings  of  the  shadows
with only one motive:'The Hunt, The Bounty, The Pleasure.'

Trolls are large, notoriously stupid swamp dwelling humanoids.  They
often have green, bulbous skin wrought with grotesque sores and yellow holes.
Their ugly hide is amazingly resiliant, giving them even greater
constitution than dragons and gargoyles.  Trolls even have the unique
ability to grow back limbs and regenerate injuries at amazing rates, giving
them fast healing as an intrinsic skill.  Trolls also, in their immense
stupidity, value nothing over the destruction of their enemies, even their
own well-being.  They are often prone to entering a berserk state.  Maximum
stats for Trolls are : 
Str(21) Int(14) Wis(14) Dex(17) Con(25)
Trolls start with 20 CP(Creation Points).

{RThe Gods of Alanthia{x

There are three paths in the Alanthia mythos, each with a patron diety. No
one is certain from where these gods arose, but all are certain of their
presence. They watch over the land from the three moons of Alanthia,
providing guidance and power to mortals in exchange for furthering their
own eternal schemes.

                {rCecilya{w, residing in the {rRed Moon{x

The path of order and creation. Mortals worshipping Cecilya place law and
serenity above all else. Cecilya is the patron goddess of the healing
arts, farmers, and craftspeople. Elves, Sprites, and Wolves are inclined
to worship Cecilya.

               {bQalethiel{x, residing in the {bBlue Moon{x

The path of non-interference and observation. Mortals worshipping
Qalethiel tend to neither seek nor avoid conflict. A popular god amongst
artificers, teachers, and ascetics. Dwarves, Minotaurs, Gargoyles, and
Dragons tend to prefer his teachings.

               {WY'golan{x, residing in the {WSilver Moon{x

The path of entropy. Y'golan's most ardent supporters are said to obtain
their greatest pleasure from destruction in all its forms. Those that
are self-cenetered and power seeking embrace Y'golan. Vampires, Wraiths,
Demons, and Drow tend to follow him.

{RGAARDE HISTORY
 
{WThroughout the history of Alanthia, it was rare to see a
band of men and women  form a clan that followed neither
the banner of L{waw{W, nor the banner of {rChaos{W.   Those that 
believe in {rChaos{W would bicker over who was the more vile
while the  others  would spend  more time spouting noble
rhetoric than truly upholding the L{waw{W.   But not all the
clans formed under the obvious banners of L{waw{W and {rChaos{W.
One clan dared to forge a new path.  A clan with no such
interest in the meaningless  squabbles of good and evil.
They desired only to aid each other, aid any others that
may seek it,  and to  gain  strength  and power in these 
lands. They battle only to maintain what they hold to be
true, and uphold their code of honor.

0 VORTEX RECALL~

{RBETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE{x
  
Alanthia's recall system is either simple or complex, depending on how you'd
like to play it. The basic premise is that when recalling, you travel through
a vortex. You can travel to any vortex of which you are aware. In order to 
add a vortex to your list, you need to find one and type '{Gvortex activate{x.'
 
If the vortex doesn't currently have an owner, it will become visible only to
you and gain a charge equal to your current level. This charge is used at a  
rate of 5 'levels' per use. Once the vortex goes below zero, it dissolves back
into the aether from which it sprang.
 
If the vortex does have an owner, it will remain in view, and you will be able
to use it freely until it dissapears, even if the owner returns and hides it
again. 
 
If you are the owner of a vortex and would like to let other people use it, you
may type '{Gvortex reveal{x' while in the room with it. Until you then type '{Gvortex
hide{x,' anyone may activate that vortex as their own. Remember that even if you
hide it, they can still use it until it is gone.
 
You may move vortexes at any any time, although you must reactivate it each
time you move it. It will not regain a charge when it is reactivated. Moving
a vortex will keep other people who have discovered it from using it any
longer.
 
You may always use the vortex that exists in Midgaard at the Temple of
Purification, but remember that some assassin may lay in wait for you there.
 
In order to see which vortexes you have available for recalling, you can type
'{Grecall show{x.' To then recall to a certain vortex, type '{Grecall <number>{x.
 
Typing '{Grecall{X' by itself will always take you to recall 0, the Temple.
 
    {RBETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE BETA CODE{x
  
It is very likely that a good deal of this will be broken. Please report all
bugs via a {Rnote to immortal{x. {RAt the current time, each player is limited

0 turf~

Turf is an idea stolen from the Swords of Chaos text BBS door game.  Each
clan now gains points for every mob it kills in a room.  If you are in a
clan and fight in a room that your clan has turfed, you receive various
bonuses.  If you are in a different clan, you are penalized.  If you are not
in a clan, you are unaffected.  This is {RBETA CODE.  {x It might break.  It
might not work.  It might do weird things.  Note Grb if there are problems. 
The only command available is 'turf,' which tells you which clan owns a
room.  It does not tell you by how much they own the room.

Some important notes to remember when building an area
======================================================
Make your rooms direction insensitive unless there is only one exit.  If 
a room has a south exit and a west exit, the line 'You enter through the 
southern door' is a bad line.  However, if the southern door is the only 
entrance to the room, it's permissible.  Also, if you are using one way 
doors, direction sensitivity is permissible.
 
Also, a room doesn't know if you've seen it before, so avoid lines like 
'you gaze on the mighty mirror of Zenabit for the first time'.
 
Avoid putting sentiments into the mind of the reader.  If the line has 
'you think' in it, it's probably bad, since you don't know if that's 
really what they think.  Try to convey things in another manner as to
make them think what you want them to think.
 
Avoid pointless anachronism.  It's tacky.  Areas should have some 
internal logic, as well as logic to the rest of the world, instead of 
just being a lump of anachronism to provoke a titter the first time, 
and gradually to become tiresome.  Strive for cleverness and wit instead.
 
Put in extra descriptions in rooms especially, but also on objects.  It 
fleshes the area out more.  Overdo extra descs rather than underdoing 
them.
 
Write utility linker rooms.  If you have a long and winding road going 
up to the castle -- write at least a couple of road rooms.  Be sure to 
say 'the castle to the north' and not 'the castle in front of you' since 
the person might have left it.
 
Write 'useless' objects for colour.  If the princess is the sort to wear
perfume, put some type furniture perfume in a type object vanity table 
that could be found if looked for.  It too fleshes out the world.  
(Note that Satin wrote 600 useless objects for Cordreas Heart, but you 
don't have to be as thorough (read insane) as her.
 
If there's furniture in a room, write it as an object and load it there, 
so that it could be sat on/etc.
 
If you have no_take objects (such as the donation pit) or mobs that 
cannot be killed and are sentinel (shopkeepers, adepts, etc.) write 
them as normal objects/mobs, consider giving them no long description, 
just a -, and describe them as part of the room, to blend them into the 
world more.  If the mob can be killed, or the object taken, though, you 
should give it a long desc, since it might not be there.
 
Do NOT write descriptions of a mobile into the room description if you 
also load that mobile in the area.  Do not do the following:
 
<room desc>
You are in a throne room.  A huge gold throne with the king of the 
goblins sitting on it is in front of you.  He cries out and several 
bodyguards attack!
Instead do:
 
<room desc>
You are in a throne room.  A huge gold throne is immediately in front of 
you.  Tapestries depicting the greatness of the ruler whose castle you 
have intruded hang on all walls.
<mobile>
The king of the goblins is here.  He cries for help!
<mobiles>
A bodyguard screams and attacks!
A bodyguard screams and attacks!
A bodyguard screams and attacks!
A bodyguard screams and attacks!
 
Of course, avoid doing descriptions like the bodyguard mobiles on just
regularly aggressive mobs who will not attack characters that they
cannot see or are below the level range of.  It's pretty stupid for a
level 300 character to walk into a room and see "A newbie school monster
screams and attacks!"
 
NEVER write an area that is too easy, or that has absurdly powerful 
equipment, just to make it popular.  Do not rely on a mobile being 
'really tough' as the sole balance to an otherwise overpowered item 
-- people have soloed 30,000hp mobiles (admittedly, people with nothing 
better to do, but you get the idea).  A well-balanced item (for example, 
the enchanted leather bracer) will ultimately earn popularity of its own 
right, and be less likely to be adjusted by a disgusted implementor who 
was tired of seeing people immort after spending a half day in your zone.  
(And then all the manly imms will laugh at you.)

    a) Levels applicable to the area.
    b) The theme or story for the area. (Not more than 1 paragraph)
    c) Approx number of rooms for the area.
The map can be in any graphics format, and doesn't need to be complete or specific, just a general outline.  You can also describe how the layout can be if you do not want to make an image of it.

2) In a separate email, send the descriptions of all your mobs, rooms, and objects.  If these are riddled with grammatical errors, it will not be considered at all.
 
3) Your area must be absolutely 100% done before you receive a builder position -- all rooms should be laid out, complete with mobs, objects, and descriptions for everything.  Your time as a builder will be spent on just putting the stuff in.

Bothering anyone about the status of your area while we're judging the
submission will not help your chances. Remember, we are committing to a lot of work with every new builder that comes on. If you don't have time to finish it, and you aren't the type of person who normally finished large projects, don't waste our time.

We will teach you OLC and help along the way.

-1 remort~

Syntax: {Gremort 'race name' 'class name'{X
 
        Remort needs to be typed twice.
        This makes sure that people don't do it by accident.
 
 You can only remort at levels 290-300. Remort means you can change into a different race and class and reach level 290 or whatever level it is you want to reach all over again. You can remort as many times as you want.
 
 But everytime you remort the amount of exp you can gain from MOBs lowers each time, but your hp, mana, and mv gains double for every remort. So when you're about a 4th remort you can get about 60 hp a level.
 
 Be warned, leveling a remort is NOT easy specially if it's your first time. It takes a lot of patience. In the end though it pays off if you can handle it.
 
{R If you experience any problems at all with your remort report it to the immortals IMMEDIATELY.{X

Typing in: {Gslot + <skill/spell name>{X

  You start out with 5 slots. Slots are used to retain skills through
a remort. Each time you remort you'll get 5 more slots. {REx: A non-remort
{Rhas 5 slots. A first time remort has 10 slots to use up.{X
  When you remort you will have the skills/spells you slotted before 
remorting, and they will each be at 75%.

{x  Trivia quests are the safest and easiest to administer/play
of all the quests. They are, as suggested by the name, comprised of
questions asked via the quest channel.  The first player to correctly
answer the question gets the point for the round.  Trivia quests
can range from random trivia, to unscrambling words, to Alanthian
trivia.  Nearly anything goes into the questions :).
{x
{CII.{x Rules :
{x    1) There will be limited arguing over the answer of a question -
{x         what the administrator accepts as the answer, is the answer
{x         unless a player can prove otherwise (maybe by a web-site).
{x      2) Arguing and fighting over who recieves a point for the round
{x         will not be tolerated - once the immortal has given the
{x         point and moved on, the issue is closed.  If you have an issue

{CI.{x Description :
{x  Tag quests are a safer quest that test one's knowledge of the 
land of Alanthia.  The immortal running the quest will morph into
a mobile and give the players hints as to where the mobile is - the
object is, obviously, to be the first player to tag the morphed 
immortal.  Death is a slight risk in this game and of course, the
administrating imm will do any corpse retrievals and transporting
of dead/stuck characters due to the quest.  As with a warp quest, 
players must find the hidden immortal via flight, foot, or boat 
only.
{x
{CII.{x Rules :
{x    1) Players who reach the immortal by any means other than foot,
{x       boat, or flight will be disqualifed from that round - this 
{x       includes any teleporting spell (nexus, summon, portal, gate, 
{x       word of recall, or teleport) and recalling.
{x    2) As with warp quests, remember that death is a slim possibility
{x         and, while your corpse will be retrieved, you will recieve
{x         no experience recomensation for fleeing, recalling, or 
{x         dying.

{x
{RI.{x Description :
{x  Warp quests are a test of one's knowledge of Alanthian geography.
Participants are given a warp pill by the quest administrator.  The
pills, when eaten, randomely teleport the players to a room in Alanthia.
The object is to sucessfully return to recall without using any
teleporting spell or recalling - ie, by foot or boat.  Since the
pills teleport with complete randomness, there is always the likelyhood
of getting lost in a no-recall room, meeting a high-level aggressive
mobile, or just plain getting lost :).  The administrating immortal
will perform corpse retrievals and transport stuck characters back
to recall to begin a new round.  Be warned though, there will be no
experience compensation for deaths and even rounds where you are stuck
will be counted.
{x
{RII.{x Rules :
{x  1) Players are not to eat the warp pill until the administrating
{x       imm gives the count-down to go.  If you are not ready, be sure
{x       let the immortal know BEFORE they hit go, or the round will
{x       count.
{x    2) Players who return to recall by any means other than foot,
{x       boat, or flight will be disqualifed from that round - this 
{x       includes any teleporting spell (nexus, summon, portal, gate, 
{x       word of recall, or teleport) and recalling.
{x    3) Please remember that this is a high-risk quest, and don't
{x       complain to the administrator if you die or get stuck.  As
{x       stated above, the administrator will retrieve your corpse
{x       and transport you back to recall if you die/get stuck. You
{x       will, though, be disqualified from that round and will not
{x       recieve experience compensation for fleeing, recalling or

{x
{RI.{x Description :
{x  Morph quests are a type of quest in which mortals are "morphed"
into a mobile.  The general object is, in some form, to be the
last survivor in the game.  The most common morph quests involves
random killing of the other morphed characters, but there have
been many variations - including tag and team wars.
{x
{RII.{x Rules :
{x  1) Players cannot begin killing each other, or casting spells on
{x     each other until the imm running the quest begins the game.
{x  2) Players are not allowed to begin spelling-up until the imm
{x     running the quest gives the okay.  There is generally a 
{x     pre-game spell up time, after which the questing imm will
{x     restore the room.
{x  3) Morphed characters are not to leave the quest area. (Usually
{x     the tag-arena in the Trioloseum).
{x  4) Before beginning the game, morphed characters are to stay in the
{x     designated room and not be wandering around the quest area.
{x  5) If the quest allows a player to choose a name, names of other
{x     characters will not be permitted.

-1 sylvan elf elves~

Sylvan Elves are, as their name says, elves of the forest.  Most never
enter cities, choosing to spend their lives in their woody home.  Sylvans,
being often good-natured and light-mooded, are the most trusted of the
races.  They are typically dark-skinned and brown-haired so as to blend in
with the forest, but a few have been known to stray from this description. 
Sylvans possess an uncanny ability to move unseen and undetected.  Their
life in the forests has also given them the ability to detect heat and
motion.  Sylvans, of course, are vulnerable to the touch of iron and
resistant to charming.  Their light build causes them to be poor warriors
and dragoons, but their stealth will allow them to be excellent thieves. 
Sylvan stats are : 
Str(19)  Int(17)  Wis(18)  Dex(20)  Con(17)
Sylvan elves start with 5 CP(Creation Points).
 
~
-1 grey elf elves greyelf greyelves~

Grey Elves are the most common of all the elven races.  They have a long
life-span, but often fail to live to longevity because of their curious and
adventurous nature.  They are the most interactive and social of the elves. 
Grey elves tend not to trust the unpredictability magic, and so make poor
mages.  They best fair in the cunning arts of thievry and assasination, but
are adequate at any class.  As typical elves, they are granted infravision
and sneak at birth.  They are also, of course, vulnerable to iron and
resistant to charm.  Their  maximum stats are : 
Str(15)  Int(21)  Wis(18)  Dex(19)  Con(15)
Greyelves start with 5 CP(Creation Points).

of an immortal. This may cause you to lose your ability to leader.

1 IMMHOOD~

{G1{g.{x Don't ask us.  We'll ask you. :)
~
0 COMPLAINT~

{cHow and how not to complain:
 
If something about Alanthia is bothering you, DO tell us. Whether it be code
problems, racial or class disparity, a crappily done area, or the behavior
of another player, we want to know about it.
 
PLEASE, Do Not complain on open channels. USE NOTES. It's easy:
 
                note to immortal
                note subject complaint
                note + <insert complaint>
                note + <insert helpful suggestion>
                note post
 
Complaining on open channels is not appreciated.  Why?  Many players
(as hard as this is to believe) won't care about your complaint, and
a lot of gossip about it will be annoying to them.  Also, many imms,
even if they are on, have certain channels turned off and may not hear
you - so you might not be speaking to anyone that can do anything about
your problem, or even care.  A note to the immortals is certain to
get our attention.
 
If there are certain immortals you don't wish to involve, don't involve
them. Anyone asking to remain anonymous will. Complaints about immortals
will be reviewed like any other.  {CThere will never be any penalty placed on
any player for lodging any complaint using the proper method. {cWe won't 
go into disclaimers of that, but, in brief: Complaining about
inability to level, lack of 'good' eq, or repeated posts of the same
complaint from the same person will be met with skepticism and probably a
quick 'note delete' unless you have a real problem.  Be specific, and 
offer any solution that comes to mind.{x
~
0 BEEP~

Don't even think about it.

Beeping is properly used to attempt to gain the attention of a single
player, usually while that person is afk. It is done by sending the string
{{* in a message. Beeps over open channels or in titles are prohibited.
Violaters will be warned once and then {Rpenguined.{x
~
0 BRIEF COMPACT~

Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact 
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.

-1 DAMAGE~

When damage is dealt, the severity of the damage is shown in
the verb. Here is a list of possible verbs, from weakest to strongest:

miss           wound          MUTILATE       DEMOLISH 
scratch        maul           DISEMBOWEL     DEVASTATE

-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~

PKILL Rules:
 
{R*{x All parties involved in the pkilling must be flagged PKILL.
{R*{x All parties involved in the pkilling must be within 25 levels.
 
Failure to obey the pkill rules results in deletion.
Screwing around and pkilling someone on accident will probably also result
in deletion. Apologizing and letting the imms know immediately if an accident
happens will mitigate the punishment.

      united under one banner to form the clan.  Whisperwolf
      ,Haldorn, Quix, and Wilhelm joined forces to aid those
      that deserve protection, and to repel those that would
      threaten their freedom.   The clan was formed in March
      of 2002.
 
{gClan {RK{ra{wrd{ri{Rs{w:

{gClan {wLoner:
      {cLoner is for those that wish for the benifits found in

      a position.  The clan was created in April of 2002.

(see 'help reply') to reply to people who were telling you before you went
deaf, although you cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are an
imm (it's mostly useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went
deaf" message to a person).  ~
-1 "AFK"~

{cSyntax:  {YAFK{c
 
Typing {YAFK{c puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing replay.
This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes, but don't
want to miss tells.  {YAFK{c shows up in your {Rprompt{c until it is turned off.
 
Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing {Rreplay{c (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).{x
~
-1 PROMPT~

Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>
 
PROMPT without an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
 
PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.

~
301 IMMROOMS~

If you would like your own immortal room, it must be in-character.
You are not allowed to have OOC descriptions.  Your immortal room
will use the vnum of the area you would like to have it in.  The
room is to be plain and simple - no ultra-regeneration rates or
anything that would benefit or harm mortals.
~
301 IMMORTEQ~

You are not allowed to make immortal equipment.  There is no need for
you to have ultra-buff equipment, or even equipment for that matter,
unless it is for roleplay purposes.  If you would like equipment,
restring standard issue equipment.
~
0 DEATH~

When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the
Temple of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were
killed, together with all of your equipment.  Any spells which were
affecting you are canceled by death.  Following and groups are not affected
by death.  You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is
two-thirds of the way back to the beginning of your level.  In addition, you
will lose 3 hp, 3 mana, and 3 movement per death, and one point off your
highest stat for every 10 deaths.  Corpses decay after time, and the objects
inside corpses decay with them.  Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of
game time (15 minutes of real time).  Only the player who died, or someone
in the same group, can retrieve objects from a player's corpse.  If your
character was flagged as a pkiller, then another pkiller may also loot your
corpse, whether you were grouped with them or not.  
~
0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~

Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set 
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; how many of 
this monster have been killed lately; and some random variation.
{CNOTE:{x Alignment no longer has an effect on the xp you gain.
~
0 PET PETS~

You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after 
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.

If you wish to name your pet, you have to name it when you buy it.
The syntax is: buy <pet> <name>
For instance, {cbuy kitten beelzebub{x will buy a kitten and name
it beelzebub.  You can then conveniently gate to or summon your
pet. Please do not give your pet the same name as you, as this
may cause problems such as your pet receiving tells aimed at you.
~
0 TICK~

Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~

Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~
0 CAST~

Syntax: {Gcast <spell> <target>{X
 
Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it. The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting. Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases until it reachers a certain point as your level
increases.
 
The {G<target>{X is optional. Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.
 
If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
{RExample:{X {Gcast 'cure crit' frag{X
Quoting is optional for single-word spells. You can abbreviate the spell name.
 
When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.
 
See also the help sections for individual spells.
~
0 EXIT~

Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a

~
0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~

Syntax: {Gdrop <object>{X
Syntax: {Gdrop <amount> coins{X
Syntax: {Gget <object>{X
Syntax: {Gget <object> <container>{X

Syntax: {Gput <object> <container>{X
 
DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.
 
GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.
 
GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.
 
PUT puts an object into a container.
 
DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~
0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~

Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
 
In equipment, the colors of where equipment worn is 
dependent upon how close to your level the equpiment is.
{gGreen{x means the equipment is within 5 levels.
{yYellow{x means it's between 5 and 10 levels.
{rRed{x means it's over 10 levels below you.
~
0 COMPARE~

Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>
 
COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
 
COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
 
COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~
0 FLEE~

Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~
0 EXAMINE LOOK~

Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~
0 ORDER~

Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~
0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~

Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~
0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~

Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~
-1 NOTE NOTES CHANGES NEWS PENALTY IDEA RPNOTE QNOTE UNREAD~

The notes on ROM replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found on many
other mud.  The following options are usable:

reading notes:
note list	: show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
note read	: either by number, or read next to read unread notes
note remove	: removes a note that you wrote or are the target of

note read to scroll through them one at a time.

Six other note directories exist, these are ideas, news, changes, rpnote,
qnote, and penalties (imms only).  They are used the exact same way, for 
example idea read 5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards
is restricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on
all the note spools.
 
{RIMPORTANT : {xWhen noting immortals, note to imm {RDOES NOT WORK!!{x
            You need to use {Rnote to immortal{x for the immortals to receive it.

synonym for GOSSIP.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.
~
0 EMOTE PMOTE POSE SOCIAL~

Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~
301 SMOTE~

Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~
0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~

Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~

Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP. 
Scrolls must be in inventory to be recited.
 
All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
 
These commands may require an item skill to be successful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~
0 CONSIDER~

Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~
0 FOLLOW GROUP~

Syntax: {Gfollow <character name>{X
Syntax: {Ggroup{X
Syntax: {Ggroup <character name>{X
 
{RFOLLOW {Xstarts you following another character. To stop following anyone else just type '{Gfollow <yourself>{X'.
 
{RGROUP {XTyping '{Ggroup <character name>{X' adds someone who is following you to your group. Group members share experience points from kills and may use the '{Ggtell{X' command to talk to all the members of the group. If anyone in your group is 
attacked, you will automatically join the fight.
 
If the person is already a member of your group, then '{Ggroup <character name>{X' will kick out the person from your group. Characters can also leave your group by typing '{Gnofollow{X' or '{Gfollow self{X' to quit following you.
 
Typing '{Ggroup{X' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
You may follow ANYONE, if you are PKILL it's recommended that you have nofollow on. You can group with anyone 25 levels or more above you so long as neither of you flees from a fight so the other can finish off the mob and get all the exp.
~
0 VISIBLE~

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~
0 QUIT RENT SAVE~

Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game 
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~
0 RECALL /~

Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to Mota for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~
-1 SPLIT~

Syntax: SPLIT  <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of gold
to split. 
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 gold
~
0 STEAL~

Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~
0 PRACTICE~

Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~
0 TRAIN~

Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to their racial maximums before practicing or training 
anything else.
~
-1 IGNORE~

{RIGNORE{c
 
Syntax: ignore <target>
 
{YIGNORE{c allows you to ignore all tells from one player.  You may ignore up to
a maximum of 10 players at any one time.
 
Ignoring someone twice will unignore them.{x
~
309 "ADVANCE"~

{cSyntax:  {Yadvance <character> <level>{c
 
{YAdvance{c sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the only way
to create new immortal characters within the game.  {YAdvance{c may also be used
to demote characters.{x
~
309 TRUST~

Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~
309 "ALLOW" "BAN" "PERMBAN"~

{cSyntax:  {Yallow <site>
{cSyntax:  {Yban   <site> <newbies|all|permit>
{cSyntax:  {Yban{c
 
{YBAN <site>{c prohibits players from that site from logging in.  {YBAN{c with no
arguments lists the banned sites.  {YALLOW <site>{c removes a site from the ban
list, if the remove is of equal or higher level than the banner.
 
A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set by
editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.  {Y*{cs
may be used to {Yban{c either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or content
(*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many sites with a
wildcard.  {YBans{c do not save unless the {Ypermban{c command is used.{x
~
309 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~

Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~
308 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~

Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-imms (i.e. level less than 301), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.
~
309 DENY~

Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~
307 DISCONNECT~

Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~
308 FREEZE~

Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a 
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~
308 FORCE~

Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, even delete!

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~
301 SOCKETS~

Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name> 

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including 
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the 
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in 
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~
307 LOAD~

Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to 
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stating an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~
307 SET~

Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~
307 STRING~

Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~
309 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~

Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshouted or notelled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~
309 PARDON~

Syntax: pardon <character> killer
	pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~
305 PURGE~

Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.
~
305 RESTORE~

Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~
307 SLAY~

Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~
304 TRANSFER TELEPORT~

Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all 
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer. 
~
303 "AT"~

{cSyntax:  {Yat <location> <command>{c
 
{YAt {cexecutes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given location.
The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of a mobile, or as the
name of an object.
 
{YAt{c works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the command,
and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your location).{x
~
301 ECHO GECHO PECHO~

Syntax: {Gecho <message>{X
        {Ggecho <message>{X
        {Gpecho <character> <message>{X
 
{RECHO{X Sends a message to all characters in the same room as the user.
 
{RGECHO{X Sends a global message for everyone to see.
 
{RPECHO{X Sends a message to a specific player that only they can see.
~
301 GOTO~

Syntax: {Ggoto <location>{X
 
Goto takes you to anyplace in the mud you want. {G<location>{X can be a
room vnum, a name of a mob, a name of an object on the ground, or the
name of a character.
~
301 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~

Syntax: {Gholylight{X
        {Gwizinvis <level>{X
 
{RHOLYLIGHT{X This allows you to see everyone your level and below invis or not.
You can even see while blind.
 
{RWIZINVIS{X This command makes you invisible to all, except those who are
higherlevel than yourself. You can enter in a level argument to set the level
of invis you want.
 
~
301 INCOGNITO~

Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~
301 MEMORY~

Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~
301 VNUM~

Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~
309 RETRIBUTION~

Syntax: retribution <string>
Syntax: retribution + <string>
Syntax: retribution -

Sets your wrath to the given string. If the retribution string starts with a
'+', the part after the '+' is added to your current retribution, so that you
can make multi-line retributions. You can delete lines by using retribution -
~
302 WRATH SMITE~

Syntax: wrath <victim> <hp> <mana> <move> <position> <equipment>

Let's you deal damage to a player. For <hp>, <mana>, and <move> put the
percentage that you want to extract from the victim, 0 - 95. For <position>,
put the position you want to set the victim in, which can be:
STAND, SIT, REST, SLEEP, STUN
For equipment, put the piece of equipment you'd like to knock off of the
victim, which can be:
LIGHT, FINGER_L, FINGER_R, NECK_1, NECK_2, TORSO, HEAD, LEGS, FEET, HANDS,
ARMS, SHIELD, BODY, WAIST, WRIST_L, WRIST_R, WIELD, HOLD, FLOAT

If you leave out one of the options, what you didn't fill out defaults to 50%
of the victim's hp, no mana, no move, 'stand' for postion, and nothing for
equipment.
~
301 STAT~

Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room 
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~
301 MWHERE~

Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~
304 PEACE~

AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~
301 POOFIN POOFOUT~

Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: poofout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~
308 PROTECT~

Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect a character from unwanted snooping.  Removing 
protected status from a character WILL be seen by that character.
~
304 LOG SNOOP~

Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Snoop shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time. Try to respect privacy.

Snoop yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
~
303 SWITCH RETURN~

Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not

~
301 IMMTALK :~

turns it back on).
~
301 WIZNET~

Syntax: wiznet 
	wiznet show
	wiznet status
	wiznet <field>

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immoral.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off, 
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here), 
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.
~
301 WIZHELP~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC' CANCELLATION~

Syntax: cast 'dispel magic' <character>
        cast 'cancellation' <characte>
 
Both of these spells remove magical effects from the target.  Dispel magic
has a reduced chance of working, and is considering an attack spell.
Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.
 
The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may
be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~

throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who.  Victims who
fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
your message.
~
0 WEAKEN~

Syntax: cast weaken <victim>

This spell reduces the strength of the victim by two points.
~
301 MPDUMP MPSTAT~

Syntax: mpstat <mobile>
Syntax: mpdump <MOBprog vnum>
                
Just like rooms, mobiles, and objects, MOBprogs also have vnums.
To find a MOBprog's vnum, use 'mpstat' on any mobile with the MOBprog
you're searching for, and look at the vnum. Mpdump shows what the actual
MOBprog program looks like, but remember that the vnum you use for Mpdump
is the vnum of the MOBprog, NOT the mobile itself that uses it.
~
0 'WORD OF RECALL'~

Syntax: cast 'word of recall'

This spell duplicates the built-in RECALL ability.  It is provided solely for
Merc-based muds which wish to eliminate the built-in ability while still
providing the spell.
~
0 'REMOVE INVISIBLE'~

Syntax: cast 'remove invisible' <victim>
Syntax: cast 'remove invisible' <object>

The remove invisible spell is a very powerful spell when used correctly, and
is also fairly self-explanatory. You may cast it on any one person or object
to dispel the invisible magicks surrounding it (as long as you can already see
the person or object through some physical or magical means, such as detect
invisble). If the spell is successful, the victim or object will become
visible to everyone in the room.
~
0 'ACID BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'GAS BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~

Syntax: cast 'acid breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'gas breath'
Syntax: cast 'lightning breath' <victim>

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.
~
0 'GUARDIAN'~

Syntax: cast 'guardian'
 
A powerful spell which brings forth an Angel from the heavens for those
 who
are pure of heart and, or a Demon from the depths of hell for those tha
t are
evil. The guardian, when created is set ten levels before the casters lev
el. The
guardian's stats vary and is a powerful ally. You can also quit with th
em, as
they also act as your pet. This spell will only work if you don't have
a pet.
 
Casting the guardian spell now costs an additional 500 exp.
~
0 'ANIMATE DEAD'~

Syntax: cast 'animate dead' <corpse>

Similiar to a type or resurrection. Animate Dead gives life to those who have
recently fallen in battle, as zombies of their former selves. This spell will
not work on the corpses of PCs, and to those who are of higher level than the
caster. This spell will only work if you don't have a pet.
~
0 'GENERAL PURPOSE'~

Syntax: cast 'general purpose' <victim>

This spell, lobs an explosive at the victim.
~
0 'HIGH EXPLOSIVE'~

Syntax: cast 'high explosive' <victim>

This spell, lobs a more devastating explosive than general purpose at the
victim.
~
0 'DONATE'~

Syntax: {Gdonate <item>{X
 
Sends Bedweezle the trusty donation wizard to collect any excess items
you may have to put in the donations pits.
~
0 'REPAIR'~

Syntax: repair <item>

At any repair shop, you may have a weapon repaired for a small fee.  Do not give the repair guy your weapon.
~
301 HEDIT~

Syntax: edit hedit <topic>
        edit hedit make <topic>

hedit <topic>      - edits the help entry
hedit make <topic> - make a new help entry will the keywords in <topic>

~
-1 ROM~

.
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of
1993,
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code. It can
be found on Rehobaom's Legacy, at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

The New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the 
originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bugs reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

Bug reports --
    Thanks to Shad Muegge, Jerome Despret, Phoenix, Will Hongach,
    Erwin S. Andreasen, Adam Debus and especially Garry Turkington
    (author of the ROM FAQ) for help spotting bugs

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's work on
Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

301 GUILD~

Syntax: guild <character> <clan | leader>
This immortal-only command lets ye make players members of clans,
or leaders.  It can also remove clan and leader status.
Examples:
{Cguild viswam tryad{x will make Viswam a member of the Tryads.
{Cguild viswam none{x will remove Viswam from his tribe.
{Cguild viswam leader{x will make Viswam a leader (if he is already
a clan member) or, if Viswam is already a leader, will remove
that status from him.
~
301 BONUS~

{XSyntax: {Gbonus <character> <field> <value>{X
{G<field>{X can be one of 2 things: exp qwest

                         {c** {RThe Rules of Alanthia{c **
                         {c***************************
 
    {cDon't cheat for mortals, especially your own.
 
    {cIf your name isn't Grbrthrxs, you are not to punish mortals for
    {canything, ever.  Period. I don't care if they call your mother
    every name in the book, disparage the mud, pkill every n0ob in
    sight and crash us 500 times. Leave them the fuck alone.
 
    No more PKilling if you're an imm. In fact, pardon all of your alts
    and leave them that way. Arguing about it will get you deleted on
    the spot.
 
    A note on qwests: Qwests are a good thing (more or less), BUT,
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes. See help {Rqprize.{c
 
    Loading a lot of something will cause them not to repop, and mortals
    can't get them. So if you have some really rare piece of eq, destroy it
    so that the mortals will have a better chance of getting one.  You are
    immortals and don't really need eq at all aside for roleplay purposes.
    So if you really need that piece of eq, have someone string you a 1st
    level piece of eq if you can't do it yourself.
 
    Do not hold EQ for morts even if they are remorting.
 
    Any modification to mortal characters must be reported.  Otherwise, this
    can be misinterpretted as cheating.
 
    Redeem/award qwest items/points of your mortals to an immortal other than
    yourself.
 
    If you do little to nothing for this mud, or you seem to be more
    interested in playing with your mortal alts, don't expect to retain your
    immortal status.
 
    Your mortals are not to have anything BUT regular mud equipment.  This
    means no restrings, no clan eq, no qprizes, no heads, and also no qpoints.
    Get rid of them if you have any of these.  You are here to work on the
    game, not to play the game.

{RRULES
 
R{rules {R - D{risobey at your own {RPeril:
  {R1. {cLimited player stealing and player killing.  For more information see
     help {Rpkill{c and help {Rsteal{c.  There are NO rules as to how you can kill
     another pkiller, as long as you are within range.
 
  {G2. {cSitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your heal.  On the one
     hand, this mud does allow {Rpkill{c, so you might find yourself DEAD when you
     come back.  On the other hand, if you choose to bot, that's fine.  But if
     you bot, you'll be treated just like any other mobile - with no respect.
     If this still doesn't dissuade you or apply to you, go for the {RAFK{c, but
     don't complain to the immortals if something bad happens.
 
  {G3. {cIf there is a problem with the mud or within the mud, email
     blue@b-side.org.  If there's an immortal on, tell them.
 
  {R4. {cCheating is not permitted.  This includes exploiting bugs you may find.
     If you don't report them and continue cheating, you put your pfile at risk.
  {R5. {cPlease encourage {Rroleplay{c at all costs.  Although you will never be forced
     to {Rroleplay{c, you should try to be in-character ({RIC{c) with everything you
     do, such as combat or small talk.  Any ridicule of anybody's {Rroleplay{c or
     screwing around with any in-character channels will result in permanent
     channels loss.  Referring to stuff said on in-character channels on 
     out-of-character ({ROOC{c) channels or vice-versa will irritate immortals.
     Deal with it on appropriate channels.
 
  {R6. Powerleveling{c and {Rcharacter sharing{c are illegal.  See the appropriate
     helpfiles for more information.
 
  {G7. {cThere are no grouping limits.  You can group with a newbie or a level 300
     person.  Just don't {Rpowerlevel{c.
 
  {R8. Harassment {cof any players of any sort will not be tolerated here.  Any
     form of sexual {Rharassment{c will automatically result in deletion and
     possibly a siteban.  Read the helpfile for more details.
 
  {G9. {cChanges to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be
     done so without evidence of sanity (!!!).  Check help {Rrules{c periodically.
     If it is changed, it will be posted in the {RMOTD{c (the first thing you see
     when you login).{x
 
{c(Rules last modified September 2, 2002){x
~
0 SUICIDE DELETE~

Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character. 
Typing delete with an argument will return your character to 'safe' status
if you change your mind after the first delete.  
~
0 HEALER~

The healer decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for his heals.  Some
services are still free to players of level 10 or below, however.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type 'heal' at his residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type 'heal <spell>'.
~
-1 GAIN~

The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has 
been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 10 practices into one training session
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions and
              can only be used by those with creation points over 50)

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~
301 CLONE~

Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~
0 SKILLS SPELLS~

The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable.
~
301 OUTFIT~

The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~
0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT AUTODEFENSE AUTODAMAGE~

ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist     : list all automatic actions
autoloot     : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold     : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac      : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit     : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit    : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit    : makes you help group members in combat
autodefense  : removes the successful parries dodges and shield blocks from battle
autodamage   : allows you to see the ammount of damage you do in a number form

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. 
~
-1 start~

No new clans are being implemented at this time.
 
~
-1 REUSE~

~
-1 COUNT~

The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~
-1 GATE~

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal 
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters recieve a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at 
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also 
immune to gate, as well as in player who has no summon set.  Clan members 
may not be gated to except by their fellow Clan members.
~
-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~

This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character. At
low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels the
effects and duration of the spell will also be shown.  Spell effects
are no longer shown on score (this can be changed by using 'show' command).
~
-1 NOVA SUNRAY~

NOVA SUNRAY
Two new mage spells of damage type 'light.' Effective in combat against
the undead.
~
-1 BREATHE~

BREATHE
syntax: breathe <target> <breath points>

Dragons may use the 'breathe' command to issue forth a searing attack,
based on the type of dragon. You may set the number of breath points you
wish to expend. If you do not specify a number, 1/10th of your maximum
will be used. Breath points increase at a rate of 1 per level, and the
damage from breathing increases with the age of the dragon.
~

For more information, see the  help files for each race (i.e. '{Ghelp dwarf{X')
~
-1 DWARF DWARVES~

Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans, known for foul tempers and great
stamina.  Dwarves make excellent fighters and priests, but are very poor
mages.  They lack the patience for stealth, and so are inadequate thieves and
assasins.  Dwarves are very resistant to poison and disease.  They receive
the berserk skill for free and can see in the dark with infravision.  
Dwarves now hold the coveted ability of beerserk. help 'beer' for more info.
Dwarves are also vulnerable to piercing weapons.  The maximum stats for Dwarves are :
Str(21) Int(16) Wis(19) Dex(14) Con(21)
Dwarves start with 10 CP(Creation Points).

-1 high elf elves highelf highelves~

High Elves are a typically snobby, and condescending breed of elf.  They
are slightly taller than most humans, and of light slender build.  Most
choose to dedicate their lives to magical studies and have a natural ability
in the arcane arts.  Though most pursue careers as mages, their typical
elven traits, such as infravision and sneaking, will allow them to become
skilled at any class.  As are all elves, they are highly vulnerable to the
touch of iron and resistant to charm and beguiling.  High elf min and max
stats are : 
Str(16)  Int(19)  Wis(21)  Dex(19)  Con(16)
Highelves start with 5 CP(Creation points).
 
~
-1 SPRITE SPRITES~

Sprites are by far the smallest of the races.  Their tiny size and
dextrous limbs make them difficult to pierce.  Sprites are by nature and
design composed of Magick and so make excellent mages.  Their size and
intelligence give them stealth and wit enough to become unsurpassed thieves.
The only classes unsuited for a sprite are those relying on brute strength
and size-- warrior and dragoon.  Their dexterity and natural instinct to
move often and quickly give sprites dodge and second attack.  They are also
gifted with sneak and fast healing.  Maximum  stats for sprites
are as follows : 
Str(15)  Int(21)  Wis(19)  Dex(21)  Con(15)
Sprites start with 20 CP(Creation Points).
 
~
-1 WRAITH WRAITHS~

Wraiths are the most powerful mages to be found anywhere in the Realms. 
They can wield more magic power in their frail bodys than a sprite and elf
put together.  A wraith is a tall, dark being that once existed as a living
and breathing mage.  By their own hands they sacrificed beauty and corrupted
their bodys, all to gain unholy powers that no mortal was ever meant to
have.  Wraiths are ethereal and translucent, passing through closed doors
with ease.  As creatures of the night, they are highly vulnerable to holy
attacks and fire.  Piercing is the only form of attack they cannot shift
their shape to accomodate.  Having no body, wraiths are resistant to
physiological attacks such as disease, and immune to poison.  Wraiths
translucent bodies are not good conductors of electricity, and so they are
highly resistant to lightning attacks.  They see easily in the dark, being
creatures of night.  Their translucence, giving them natural stealth, and
ability to drink the life of a victim make them skilled assasins and
adequate thieves.  Wraiths, having no body and substance with which to
fight, make poor warriors and dragoons.  Holy paths are difficult for
wraiths, being creatures made of magic and evil.  Dodge, lore, and sneak are
natural abilities of a wraith.  Their statistics are : 
Str(17)  Int(22)  Wis(18)  Dex(21)  Con(16)
Wraiths start with 15 CP(Creation Points).
 
~
-1 GARGOYLE GARGOYLES~

Gargoyles are huge creatures of stone, with claws and teeth the size of
the average human's forearm.  Dwarfing the minotaur, and sometimes even the
demon, in pure strength, the gargoyle is an exceptional warrior.  Because of
their immense strength and dedication to the fighting arts, the gargoyle
recieves the bash, parry, and enhanced damage skills for free.
Gargoyles are creatures created by magic.  Stone brought to life, often to
defend a keep or castle.  Their stoney hides are resistant to weapons
pierce, but highly vulnerable to magical attacks.  They recieve lore for
free, to aid in the protection of their stronghold.  Gargoyles prefer brute
strength to thought and cunning and so make only average mages and clerics
and poor assasins and thieves.  Gargoyle's statistics are : 
Str(22)  Int(16)  Wis(18)  Dex(16)  Con(21) 
Gargoyles start with 20 CP(Creation Points).
 
~
-1 HUMAN HUMANS MAN~

Humans are the most common race in the world, and make up the majority of
adventurers.  They are your average, everyday race-- medium sized and
possessing no special skill or traits.  Humans are well-rounded and equally
skilled at all the classes.   Maximum stats for humans are as
follows : Str(18) Int(18) Wis(18) Dex (18) Con(18) 
Humans start with 0 CP(Creation Points).
 
~
-1 MINOTAUR MINOTAURS~

Ranging from 7-10 feet in height, minotaurs are second in size only to
dragons.  They are stronger than any other race, and almost as durable as
the dwarves.  They aren't too bright, however, and their huge size makes
them more clumsy than the other races.  Minotaurs make the best warriors and
dragoons of any race, but are ill-suited for any other profession.  Because
of their overwhelming size and brute strength, they are gifted with bash,
hand to hand.  Their size and durability make them
resistant to bashing.  Minotaurs thrive on cold climates and so are
resistant to cold attacks, but highly vulnerable to fire.  
Minotaur statistics are as follows :
Str(22)  Int(15)  Wis(18)  Dex(15)  Con(20)  
Minotaurs start with 10 CP(Creation Points).
 
~
-1 DEMON DEMONS~

Demons are tough and powerful, ranging in size from 9-12 feet.  They have
dark, red skin, massive claws, short stubby wings, and razor-sharp teeth. 
Demons naturally have huge muscles.  Though born fighters, Demons can handle
any class, with the exception of the holy paths of cleric and paladin. 
Demons come equipped with invade, dodge, lore, enhanced damage, and the
ability to see in the dark.  Demon's evil eyes can pierce the soul and see
goodness.  Being born of evil and fire, demons are highly resistant to firey
attacks, poison, and disease.  Their black hearts and flaming skins can be
pierced only by holy wraths and cold.  The maximum  stats for
demons are : 
Str(20)  Int(18)  Wis(18)  Dex(18)  Con(18)
Demons start with 20 CP(Creation Points).
 
~
-1 WOLF WOLVES~

These creatures prowl the Realms in search of their next meal.  They have
the sharp instincts of the wild, but limited intelligence and wisdom to
apply this knowledge in any but the most instinctual ways.  Their bodies of
solid muscle make them extremely effective warriors.  They are somewhat
proficient at thievery, and mediocre in the Archane Arts.  Due to their
animalistic traits, wolves are born with dark vision.  Their fighting skills
of enhanced damage, second attack, and dodge are bestowed at birth.  Wolven
statistics are : 
Str(21)  Int(16)  Wis(19)  Dex(18)  Con(20)
Wolves start with 15 CP(Creation Points).

-1 dragon dragons reddrg grndrg bludrg blkdrg glddrg whtdrg red green white blue black gold~

The greatest, most powerful of any race ever to dwell within the Realms,
the dragon is almost God-like in it's ability to crush, stomp, and
completely vaporize any creature that would so much as dare stand in its
way.  Although usually seen as supreme warriors, these flying beasts can
handle any class with ease.  All dragons wield the magicks of breath
weapons, along with bash .  The vulnerabilities and immunities of a dragon
depends upon it's color.  Each color dragon is representative of a different
element, and weilds the powers of that element.  All are resistant to bashing.  
The dragons of Alanthia are as follows :
DRAGON    RESISTANCE   VULNERABILITY

All Dragons start with 21 CP(Creation Points), except for Prism Dragons who start with 25.
~
-1 VAMPIRES~

Vampires have the ability to drink the blood of their prey.  They gain
life force from this blood, hence forth Blood Points.  Blood is the life
force of a vampire.  Blood grants a vampire partial immortality, so when you
reach 0 hp, if you have more than 6 bp, you will be reducded to 3 bp and you
will gain 3 hp for every bp over 3.  Along with partial immortality,
vampires also have the inate ability to fly.  The main powers of a vampire
come from blood.  Therefor your BP will slowly reduce itself.  1 BP for
every 2 ticks.  This causes a growing thirst for blood.  You must feed in
order to stay alive.  However, even a vampire must must sleep.  While
sleeping, your BP will still decrease, during day but not night.  Vampires
are equiped with fast healing, and have the innate ability to detect good
and see in the dark.  With their horrid backgrounds, vampires are extremely
vulnerable to holy magics and light.  They are also very flammable.  All in
all, vampires are a generally good race to start out with, they fair the
best as warriors but also make good mages.  They do not make very good
Paladins or Clerics for that fact.  Being undead, vampires are resistant to
the effects of poison and disease.  
Vampire stats are :
Str(23) Int(18) Wis(18) Dex(18) Con(23)
Vampires start with 21 CP(Creation Points).
 
~
-1 CHICKENS~

The vicious chickens of Aung-Gorr aren't particularly vicious, or that 
dangerous for that matter.  It's just that nobody knows what to do when
confronted with a knee-high chicken wielding a broadsword or casting a
fireball.  Either way, it's best watch ones step when around these 
peculiar fowls from across the desert.
Chicken stats are:
Str(15) Int(16) Wis(16) Dex(25) Con(17)
Chickens start with 20 CP(Creation Points).

the ages, the Drow have mastered immunity to disease and resistance to
poison.  Their evil souls are vulnerable to holy, light, and fire.  Their
dark ruthlessness has enabled them with the ability to cause enhanced damage
to their opponents.  Spending endless hours in their dark underground cities
has heightened their eyesight to see infrared.  They are also able to detect
magical auras.  Drow stats are :

him or her to start out with more skills than normal. Don't worry you can still
gain other skills after creation without the worry of your creation points
increasing.
 
Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit. There is a
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.
 
The experience breakdown is as follows:
points   exp/level    points   exp/level
40       1000          90       6000
50       1500          100      8000

shields in two.  
~

-1 HARMFUL~

This spell group is the opposite of healing.  The harmful spells are designed
to tear flesh from bone, rupture arteries, and generally turn the body against
itself.  Only priests and warriors may use this spell group.
In order of power, the harmful spells are:

cause light	    inflicts minor wounds on an enemy
cause serious	inflicts wounds on a foe
cause critical  causes major damage to the target
harm		    the most deadly harmful spell
~
-1 HEALING~

The healing spells are used to cure the wounds that adventurers inevitably
suffer in battle.  For curing other conditions, such as poison, see the
curative spell group.  Only warriors and priests have access to this group.
In order of power, the healing spells are:

cure light	    heals minor wounds
refresh		    restores vigor to a tired adventurer
cure serious	heals wounds
cure critical	closes all but the worst wounds
heal		    the most powerful healing spell
mass healing	casts a heal spell on each player in the room
~
-1 ILLUSION~

The illusions spells are dedicated to deception and trickery.  They can be
used to mask appearances, or create distractions for the party.  Currently,
the illusion group is very small, but it will be expanded in the future.
Only thieves and mages can cast illusion spells, which consist of the 
following:

invis		    turns the target invisible
mass invis	    turns the caster's group invisible
ventriloquate	allows the caster to put words in someone's mouth
~
-1 MALADICTIONS~

Maladictions are a group of curses and other baneful spells, designed to
cripple, inconvenience, or torture, rather than kill outright.  These spells
may be cast by any class.

 
animate dead       causes a recently killed corpse to be brought back
                   to life.  The zombie acts as a pet/charmie.
blindess           strikes the target blind
curse              prevents recalling and weakens the target in combat
energy drain       drains experience and mana, while strengthening
                   the caster
plague             causes the target to suffer a slow, painful death 
                   from plague
lethargy           reduces the number of attacks and makes it 
                   impossible for target to flee
weaken             drains the strength of the target
~
-1 PROTECTIVE~

The protective spells are used to shield against harm, whether from spells or
physical attack.  They range from the weak armor spell to the sought-after
sanctuary charm.  Also included in this group are several spells for dispeling
hostile magics. Any class may use this group, which consists of the following 
spells:

armor		      provides the target with an extra layer of defense
cancellation	  a powerful dispel, used for removing spells from friends
dispel magic	  removes spells from enemies, not as effective as cancel
fireproof	      shields items from the harmful effects of fire and acid
guardian	      summons a demon or an angel to help you.
protection evil	  provides defense from the attacks of evil creatures
protection good   protects from the attacks of good beings
sanctuary	      reduces all damage taken by the recipient by half
shield		      puts a shimmering shield between you and your enemies
stoneskin	      turns skin hard as stone, providing a huge armor boost
~
-1 TRANSPORTATION~

The transportation group is used for travel, whether by flight, magical
teleportation, or walking through walls.  All classes may learn these spells,
which are among the most useful in the game.

fly		        allows the target to fly over nearly all obstacles
gate		    transports the caster to the target
nexus		    forms a two-way portal to a far off destination
pass door	    allows the caster to walk through walls
portal		    creates a one-way portal to a destination
summon		    transports the target to the caster
teleport	    sends the target to a random location
word of recall	transports the caster to safety in Midgaard
~
-1 WEATHER~

These spells allow the caster to manipulate local weather conditions, as well
as summon fog clouds, lightning, or even electrical glows.  This group is
usable by only clerics.

call lightning	 summons a huge bolt from the heavens, if the weather is right
control weather	 changes the weather in the manner desired by the caster
faerie fire	 surrounds the target in a glowing aura
faerie fog	 reveals all hidden creatures in the room
lightning bolt	 sends a bolt of electricity into the target

(the weather command, unrelated to this group, shows local weather conditions)
~
-1 SPECIALTIES~

New and varied spells for Alanthia. We hope you enjoy them.

teleport obj    allows you to give an object to someone that is in another room
talon		causes the target's weapon to be unremoveable.
~
-1 ASSASSINATE~

ASSASSINATE
Only those trained as assassins have the ability to utilize this skill. 
Assassinate allows the perpetrator to instantly slay their foe. Its rate of
success is increased while sneaking, and bonuses are encountered if the
opponent is asleep. The act of assassination does not yield experience to
the perpetrator.
~
-1 BACKSTAB~

Backstab is the favored attack of  thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing weapons.
The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.
Only thieves and assassins may learn the backstab.
~
-1 BASH~

The bash skill is an offensive talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
bash rating, your weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon
is not generally a wise idea.
~
-1 BERSERK~

Only powerful fighters can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking combatants are more resistant to the effects of magic. 
BERSERK CAN NOT BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH FRENZY.
~
-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  
~
-1 DISARM~

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only those dedicated to
fighting or stealth may learn this skill.
~
-1 DODGE~

In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where he/she/it may successfully
evade many blows.  The chance of dodging is affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  All classes, except for Clerics, may learn to
dodge.  
~
-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~

Combatants can become skilled enough in combat that they are able to
inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked for with
each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus is very
low indeed.  
~
-1 ENVENOM~

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~
-1 FOURTH ATTACK~

Training in fourth attack allows the character a chance at an additional 
strike in combat--though 100% fourth attack does NOT guarantee 4 attacks
each round. Fourth attack increases the chance of a second and third attack.
Paladins, warriors, draggons, thieves, and assassins may gain this skill.
~
-1 FIFTH ATTACK~

Training in fifth attack allows the character a chance at an additional
strike in combat--though 100% fifth attack does NOT guarantee 5 attacks
each round. Fifth attack increases the chance of a second, third, and fourth
attack. This skill is available to warriors, dragoons, and assassins only.
~
-1 SIXTH ATTACK~

Training in sixth attack allows the character a chance at an additional
strike in combat--though 100% fifith attack does NOT guarantee 6 attacks
each round. Sixth attack increases the chance of a second, third, fourth, 
and fifth attack. This skill is available to warriors only.
~
-1 WHIRL CIRCLE~

Whirl and circle causes you to flank or circle your opponent and suddenly 
change the direction of your attack. A successful whirl or circle gives an
extra round of combat in which the opponent is not able to block the attack
via parry, dodge, or shield block.
~
-1 DUCK~

Duck allows a percentage chance to succesfully evade a whirl or circle
attack.
~
-1 'HAND TO HAND'~

Hand to hand combat is a rare skill in the lands of Midgaard.  Learning
this style of fighting gives the player a weapon even when disarmed -- bare
hands.  Trained hand to hand experts are far more effective than many
swordsmen.  Clerics and warriors are the best at this skill, although any
class may also learn it.  
~
-1 INVADE~

This skill allows characters to gain entrance into rooms that would
otherwise be off limits to them.  Its success rate is increased if the
character is sneaking or invisible to those within the room.  Thieves and
assassins are the only classes able to train in this skill.  Non-aggressive
clanhalls cannot be invaded by any player.  
~
-1 KICK~

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.  Fighters
and clerics are the most skilled at kicking, although any class may learn to kick.
~
-1 PARRY~

If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~
-1 RESCUE~

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a fighter with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~
-1 TRIP~

Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  
~
-1 'SECOND ATTACK'~

Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- though a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
very hard time with it.
~
-1 'THIRD ATTACK'~

Training in third attack allows the character a chance at an additional
strike in a combat, and increases the chance of a second attack as well. 
Perfect third attack does NOT assure three attacks per round.  Any class may
learn this skill.  
~
-1 SNEAK~

Sneak allows the character to move through the realm undetected. This skill 
aids in the success rate of assassinate and invade, and it also allows the 
character to slip by mobs without their knowledge. 
~
-1 'FAST HEALING'~

The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~
-1 LORE~

Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.  It also may occasionally increase the value
of an object, because more will be known about its worth.  All classes may
learn lore, although thieves are best at it, and warriors find it very hard
to use.
~
-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
~
-1 PEEK~

The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  A few classes may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~
-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~

Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. 
~
-1 MEDITATION~

This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
~
-1 STEAL~

Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise 
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~
-1 'DETECT GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~
-1 'DISPEL GOOD'~

Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on 
the pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their
peril.
~
-1 'RECHARGE'~

Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~
-1 'DEMONFIRE'~

Syntax: cast 'demonfire' <target>

Demonfire is a spell of blackest evil, and as such can only be used by those
who follow the paths of darkness.  It conjures forth demonic spirits to 
inflict terrible wounds on the enemies of the caster.
~
-1 'RAY OF TRUTH'~

Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~
-1 'PORTAL'~

Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~
-1 'NEXUS'~

Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~
-1 'HEAT METAL'~

Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment
(assumed to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
~
-1 'HOLY WORD'~

Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~
-1 'TELEPORT OBJECT'~

Syntax: cast 'teleport object' <object> <target>

This spell allows you to break a rift in space and hand an item to someone
that is not in the same room as you.
~
-1 TALON~

Syntax: cast 'talon' <target>

This spell causes the target's grip to become unbreakable. The target cannot
be disarmed while the spell is in effect.
~
-1 FRENZY~

Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment. FRENZY CANNOT BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH BERSERK.
~
-1 CALM~

Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~
-1 HASTE~

Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the lethargy. (see 'help lethargy').
~
-1 LETHARGY~

Syntax: cast 'lethargy' <target>
According to popular mythology, lethargy is the opposite of
haste, it's a spell with it's own unique set of effect.
When cast on an unfortunate victim, it slows its movements,
making it easier to hit and reducing its rate of attack.
The effects of lethargy also double movement costs and 
double healing rates.  
~
-1 PLAGUE~

Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~
-1 'CREATE ROSE'~

Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~
-1 'PROTECTION GOOD' 'PROTECTION EVIL'~

Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>
	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~
0 'GIANT STRENGTH'~

Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~
-1 'CHAIN LIGHTNING'~

Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members 
of a clan, while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other
viable target remains.  Chain lightning is most effective when used on
groups of creatures.
~
-1 FARSIGHT~

Syntax: cast 'farsight'
	cast 'farsight' <direction>

The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her
to see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes.
The spell may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in
all directions, or with a directional component to see creatures much
farther away.
~
-1 MASS HEALING~

Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~
-1 'FLOATING DISC'~

Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caser
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a 
maximum of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location
on the character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it
to run out of energy.
~
-1 FIREPROOF~

Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~
-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~

Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the alias with 
that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and argument 
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
~
-1 BOUNTY~

{cSyntax: bounty <name> <amount>
 
This command is used for setting a bounty on another pker.  Use this channel
ONLY if you have the means to pay the one that does the deed.  There is a 1000
gold minimum to set a bounty and a 9,999,999 gold maximum.  Should you not pay.
this person, the immortals will strike you down and you will be shamed as a
mortal and will always have a bounty on your head and your bounty priviledges
will be revoked!  I say again, do not use this channel as a toy, it is for RP
purposes only!
 
Any character who brings in the head {R*{cMUST{R*{c be paid, regardless of who
killed the character.
 
To get a list of bounties, type {Ybounty{c.  This will only show bounties of the
players currently logged into the mud.
 
To see who placed the bounty on a specific person, type {Ybounty <name>{c.{x

0 HITDICE~

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles hitpoints.
Suggested values are:

       level:     dice         min         max        mean
         1:       1d2+6       7(  7)     8(   8)     8(   8)

	50:    10d169+920   930(923)  2610(2610)  1770(1767)

Diff = max - min.  Mean is the arithmetic mean.
The values in parenthesis are the the standard merc values.
~
0 MANADICE~

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles mana.
The values the server generates for merc-type mobs is

  <level> d 10 + 100

where level is the level of the mobile.
~
0 DAMDICE~

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles hitpoints.
Suggested values are:

       Level      dice       min      min    mean
        1         1d2+0       1        2       2
        2         1d2+1       2        3       3
        3         1d3+2       3        5       4
        5         2d3+2       4        8       6

       50         5d10+25    30       75      53

Mean is the arithmetic mean.  The values in parenthesis are the the
standard merc values.  (Will be put in when there's time to calculate
them...)
~
304 RESETS~

Syntax: RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

    80        -400     -400     -400    -150

These values are 10 times what you would put in an area file. This
is because the server multiplies what it reads from file with 10.
