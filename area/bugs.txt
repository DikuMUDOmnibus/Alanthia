[19843] Mournrier: In the middle of combat, when it turns night, everyone in the room turns to a someone, and you can't see ANYTHING, even if you do have a light.  Only way to restore sight is to leave the room.  It's very annoying and hurtful in combat
[ 3758] Tsugachi: I had my intellegence at 19, and i trained 1 more time, and it stayed at 19, and said my intellegence increased! And the helpfile for drows says the max int for drow is 18.

[19103] Hespin: Whips is NOT a basic skill of the clerics.  It is shown in creation, however, a player that chooses whip will not have that skill to practice as a newbie.  Check that out... it's kinda strange.
[ 3036] Hespin: Bless does not change hit roll in the score screen... I do not know if this means that bless is uneffective (since I cannot really tell that), or if it's just the display.

[ 3001] Gohan: Mobprogs for 'if then' for classes does not work no matter what class you put for the mob to react to.
[ 5221] Whisperwolf: the floating stones from the lamias dont actually affect what they say they do!!!
[ 3019] Whisperwolf: I know in one of the last changes posted, remort skills actually can GO over 75%, but do they actually start at 75%? Cause i dont feel any sneakier as if I was at 1% and it hasn't gone up to 76% in over 1000 or so sneaks
