You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of
Purification.  The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks,
eternal in appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall
paintings picturing gods, giants and peasants.  Large steps lead down
through the grand temple gate, descending the huge mound upon which the
temple is built and ends on the temple square below.  Equally large steps
lead UP through a small door into the ENTRANCE to MUD SCHOOL.  (type 'up' to
go to MUD SCHOOL.)  A small plaque is on this wall.

walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood, rescued
from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards carved and
painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some musical or
other blends with the dusty golden light and the wonderful smells to put you
complete at ease.  A huge picture window looks out over the Midgaard River,
and a doorway leads north into the dock and the south bank river landing,
while the main entrance to the south returns you to Austral Square.  On most
days you will find Kate here, testing a batch of stew or brewing a special
pot of cinnamon brew, eerily just in the time for your arrival.

Two small towers surround a strong wooden gate, connected by a small
stone bridge set with murder holes.  This gate is not as heavily guarded as
the others, as the plains outside are safe to travel.  You can leave
midgaard to the north, or continues along wall road to the west and east.  A
teeming clan street is visible to the south, and beyond that the graceful
spires of the Temple of Purification, but there is no way to reach them from
