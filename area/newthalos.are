Tall green grass hangs slightly over the cobbles on the edges of the
road.  Well-tended lawns, speading out to the east and west, lend a deep
green color to this dry area.  The heady odor of wildflowers and pine
needles rides the comfortable breeze, allowing one to see the cultivated
nature of this place.  To east is the famous Museum of the Greater Gods.

One of the most popular shops in New Thalos, this shop is always a hive
of activity.  It is almost inhuman the way one man can fix all the area's
armor singlehandedly.  If you have an item in need of repair simply give it

on sections of armor in the back of the shop, their hammers working too fast

Art Exhibit~
You are standing in the Sultan's tribute to the finer virtues.  Large
paintings hang from the walls displaying nature scenes, nudes, and glorious
victories in battle.  Strange scupltures rest on pedestals at each corner of
the room and mirrors are placed in strategic locations so the viewer may see
an entire sculpture at a glance.  Your eyes, however, are pulled towards a
painting that dominates the far wall.

On a road~
You walk along a well used road with beautiful scenery.  To the north
tall pine trees form a wall that goes on for miles.  Between the road and
the trees lies a great expanse of grassy plains.  South of here, beyond the
river, lie the Sands of Sorrow.  The road continues east and west.

On a road~
This is the main land route through the land.  Merchants can bring their
goods to the coastline and have them ferried onto ships for export.  Travel
by foot west will take you through New Thalos up and over the Eastern

Near the shore~
The road ends here turning into a small dirt path leading down the beach
and onto a dock.  To the north and south you see the coastline stretching
out before you.  West of here the lowlands roll up into huge snow capped
mountains.

On a dock~
You stand on a simple wooden dock that acts as an extension of the road
to the west.  The dock seems to have been here for quite a long time but is
still sturdy.  A small ladder has been built on the eastern end to allow
easy access to and from ships.

altar is a silver chalice filled with ruby red wine, and beside the chalice
is a loaf of unleavened bread.  A large holy symbol keeps watch over the
altar.

The floor of this room is completely carpeted in overlaying ancient rugs,
and the walls are covered in an odd hodgepodge of maps, drawings, and
enscripted banners.  In each of the four corners, a large yellow globe lends
its clear light to the vibrant colors of the paintings and carpets.  There
is a doorway into the foyer south, an open doorway to the east, and a closed
door west and north.  There is a large red sign posted on the west door.
