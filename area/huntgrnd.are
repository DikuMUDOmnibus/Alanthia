blue dragon~
a mammoth blue dragon~
An enormous blue dragon surveys the room through golden eyes.
~
Golden orbs shift from side to side, dragging black spots that slide
across the rounded surfaces like drops of oil.  An enormous tail, covered in
blue scales that shimmer like mica, flips in sudden, spontaneous movement,
and eyebrows the color of the sky on a rainy day arch in gentle suspicion,
settling back into their gentle line after a few moments.  The huge beast's
body rises and falls in slow rhythm with his breathing, and a faint trail of
smoke leads from his wide nostrils up towards the ceiling.

A kesthai azul is masked by fierce war paint.
~
A tall, statuesque figure, larger than your average human, has eyes of
the purest blue like the sky after rain clouds clear and skin the color of
death.  Long legs with wiry, flexible joints can span enormous distances,
and thin arms have become muscular from constant service to the dragons. 
Dedication shines in the vivid blue eyes, and faith is written in the
markings of the elaborate face paintings.

a gnarled tree~
An old tree winks at you as you pass.
~
Long ago, the King's men were cutting down some timber for the winter,
when they stumbled upon this monstrosity.  They were quickly loosened from
their axes, only to reunite with them in the middle of their foreheads.  The
cut marks are clearly visible on the bottom of this creature, oozing with a
syrupy blood.

into a tasselled tail that flicks back and forth emphatically.  The golden

Outside the Northern Gate~
The northern gate of the castle rises high above, an obsidian arch carved
with the figures of warriors and beasts alike.  A huge crater, nearly two
hundred feet in length, scars the northern wall, and a turret is missing
entirely on the eastern side.  An enormous oak forest opens across the moat
to the north, riddled with faint trails that lead into the depths of the
hunting grounds.  There is a small {yplaque{x embedded in a tree.

fantastic hunting, and for containing the most unusual creatures.  Some say
that the forest is "stocked" with good hunting animals, but some creatures
have only been known to be found here.  Nevertheless, it is guaranteed that
some interesting adventure lies in wait of anyone who enters.

A Path of Stomped Down Trees~
This is a slightly more traveled region of the road, making you believe
you are approaching a more populated area.  You are not sure what kind of
population, but you are pretty certain that the creatures must be big.  The
road extends to the east and west from here.

A House For Hill Giants~
You have come upon a large fort structure.  The walls rise about eighty
feet in the air, and consist of tree trunks planted into the ground like
bean poles.  There is no roof, and the front door (which you just walked
through) is wide open.  You can exit the place by going west, or you can
explore it further by going north or east.

You have entered another room in this monstrous structure.  A large fire
pit is in the center of the room, and some trees, snapped in half as if they
were sticks, lie next to it.  About thirty deer carcasses are piled up in
one corner, completely stripped of meat.  Flies buzz around the heap,
searching for morsels.

Drainage off a hillside has created a precarious path of leaves and mud
which leads up to the top of a nearby tree.  The tree seems to be dead from
the constant mud slides, but you notice a very large birds nest perched on
one of the top branches.  It might be worth the risky path to see what is in
the nest.  From here you can climb the tree by going south, or head back to

A Druid's Home~
You set foot into a druid's home.  It is not build of anything artifical,
nor have the local plants been disturbed to create this place.  From the
looks of it, this looks like it was naturally formed.  A stump provides a
place to sit.  Herbs are scattered along the floor, and all sorts of exotic
plants and flowers blossom with life.

Path to a Small Clearing~
Tree stumps and roots have decayed and been trampled on for many years,
resulting in a trail leading to a small clearing.  There are many footprints
on the ground of a wide variety of animals leading to this clearing to the
south.  North leads back to the main deer trail.
