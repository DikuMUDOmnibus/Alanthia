The light seems to shift and change even as you look at it.  This is
the drakyri Mediator, a blend of the souls of those drakyri who devoted
their lives to the increase of wisdom and willingly gave their souls
in death to serve the council.  The Mediator resides over the council
when it is in session and resolves disputes.  Due to its ancient wisdom,
it passes the final judgment on all issues that affect the race as a whole.
