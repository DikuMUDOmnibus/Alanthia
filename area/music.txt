Bullet the Blue Sky~
In the howling wind comes a stinging rain
See it driving nails into souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly, a red orange glow
See the face of fear running scared in the valley below
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel and the angel was overcome
Plant a demon seed, you raise a flower of fire
See them burning crosses, see the flames, higher and higher
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Suit and tie comes up to me
His face red
Like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peeling off those dollar bills
Slapping them down, one hundred, two hundred,
And I can see the fighter planes
And I can see the fighter planes
Across the mud huts as the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quit city street
Up the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
A man breathes deep into a saxophone
Through the walls we hear the city groan
Outside is America
Outside is America

You Oughta Know~
I want you to know that I'm happy for you
I wish nothing but the best for you both
An older version of me
Is she as perverted as me
Would she go down on you in a theater?
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she would make a really excellent mother
Cause the love that you gave that we made 
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And everytime you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me 
Until you died 'til you died
But you're still alive
And I'm here to remind you 
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bare that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know
You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap on the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her
Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me
And I'm not going to fade
As soon as you close your eyes and you know it
And everytime I scratch my nails down someone else's back
I hope you feel it ...can you feel it?
And I'm here to remind you 
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bare that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know why I'm here
To remind you 
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me of the cross I bare that you gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

Comfortably Numb~
Hello hello hello...
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone home?
Come on, now.
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain,
Get you on your feet again.
Relax relax relax...
I need some information first.
Just the basic facts:
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
When I was a child I had a fever.
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I got that feeling once again.
I can't explain, you would not understand.
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
Ok ok ok...
Just a little pinprick. <ping>
There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working. Good.
That'll keep you going for the show.
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone.
I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.

Empire~
Last night the word came down, ten dead in Chinatown.
Innocent, their only crime was
Being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Too bad, people say
What's wrong with the kids today
Tell you right now they've got nothing to lose
They're building EMPIRE!
Johnny used to work after school
At the cinema show.
Gotta hustle if he wants an education
He's got a long way to go.
Now he's out on the street all day
Selling Crack to the people who pay.
Got an AK-47 for his best friend
Business the American way.
Eastside meets Westside downtown.
No time, the walls fall down
Can't you feel it coming? EMPIRE!
Can't you hear it calling?
Black man, trapped again.
Hold his chain in his hand.
Brother killing brother for the profit of another,
Game point, nobody wins.
Decline, right on time.
What happened to the dream sublime?
Tear it all down, we'll put it up again.
Another EMPIRE?
Eastside meets Westside downtown.
No time, no line, the walls fall down.
Can't you feel it coming? EMPIRE!
Can't you hear it coming EMPIRE!
Can't someone here stop it...?

Imagine~
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

I Still Haven't Found What I'm...~
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
Only to be with you
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm as the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
But yes I'm still running
You broke the bonds
You loosed the chains
You carried the cross
And my shame
And my shame
You know I believe it
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

Jack the Ripper~
Oh you look so tired
Mouth slack and wide
Ill-housed and ill-advised
Your face is as mean as your life has been
Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree but you don't refuse
I know you
And I know a place
Where no one is likely to pass
Oh you don't care it it's late
And you don't care if you're lost
And oh you look so tired
But tonight you presume too much
Too much.. too much
And if it's the last thing I ever do
Oh I'm gonna get you
Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree but you don't refuse
I know you
Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree but you refuse
I know you

The Joker~
Some people call me the space cowboy.
Yea...
Some call me the gangster of love.
Some people call me Maurice.
Cause I speak of the pompotous of love.
People talk about me baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong.
Well you worry, baby, don't worry.
Cause I'm right here, right here,
Right here, right here at home.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
I get my lovin' on the run.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.
Ohey, baby, I'll sure show you a good time.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
Sure don't want to hurt no one.
People keep talking about me, baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong.
Well you worry, don't worry,
No don't worry mama.
Cause I'm right here at home.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.
Come on baby. Show me a good time.

One Of My Turns~
Oh my God, what a fabulous room!
Are all these your guitars?
This place is bigger than our apartment.
Uh, could I have a drink of water?
Ya want some?  Huh?
Oh wow!  Look at this tub!
Wanna take a bath?
What're you watching?
Hello?
Are you feeling ok?
Day after day,
Our love turns gray,
Like the skin on a dying man.
And night after night,
We pretend it's all right,
But I have grown older,
And you have grown colder,
And nothing is very much fun, anymore.
And I can feel,
One of all my turns coming on.
I feel,
Cold as a razor blade,
Tight as a tourniquet,
Dry as a funeral drum.
Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left,
You'll find my favorite axe.
Don't look so frightened,
This is just a passing phase,
One of my bad days.
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate a silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?  -- Would ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Ooohh. No!
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?

Red Hill Mining Town~
From father to son
The blood runs thin
Our faces frozen (still) against the wind
The seam is split
The coal face cracked
The lines are long
And there's no going back
Through hands of steel
And a heart of stone
Our labour day has come and gone
And you leave us holding on
In Red Hill Town
As the lights go down
I'm hanging on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm holding on
You're all that's left to hold on to
The glass is cut
The bottle run dry
Our love runs cold
In the caverns of the night
We're wounded by fear
Injured in doubt
I can lose myself
You I can't live without
Because you keep me holding on
In Red Hill Town as the lights go down
I'm hanging on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm holding on
You're all that's left to hold on to
And we scorched the earth
Set fire to the sky
Stoop so low to reach so high
A link is lost
The chain undone
Now we wait all day
For the night to come
And it comes
And it comes
Like a hunter (child)
I'm hanging on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm hanging on
We see love slowly stripped away
Our love, has seen a better day
I'm hanging on
You're all that's left to hold on to
I'm hanging on
You're all that's left to hold on to
See the lights go down on Red Hill Town
See light go down on Red Hill Town

Rock of Ages~
I've got something to say
It's better to burn out, than fade away
Rise up! Gather round
Rock this place to the ground
Burn it up, let's go for broke
Watch the night go up in smoke
Rock on! Rock on!
Drive me crazier,
No serenade, no fire brigade
just Pyromania
What do you want?
What do you want?
I want rock'n'roll, yes I do
Long live rock'n'roll
Let's go, let's strike a light
We're gonna blow like dynamite
I don't care if it takes all night
Gonna set this town alight
What do you want? 
What do you want?
I want rock'n'roll, alright!
Long live rock'n'roll
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages
Still rollin', keep rollin'
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages
Still rollin', rock'n'rollin
We got the power, got the glory
Just say you need it, and if you need it say yeah!
I'm burnin' burnin' I got the fever
I know for sure, there ain't no cure
So feel it, don't fight it, go with the flow
gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme one more for the road
What do you want? 
What do you want?
I want rock'n'roll, you betcha
Long live rock'n'roll
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages
Still rollin', keep rollin'
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages
Still rollin', rock'n'rollin
We got the power, got the glory
Just say you need it, and if you need it say yeah!
We're gonna burn this damn place down
down to the ground

Silent Lucidity~
Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?
There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize it and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity
Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Hug me
If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help to see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you....

Sweet Child O' Mine~
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that
special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me
of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by
Sweet child o' mine
Sweet love of mine
Where do we go
Where do we go now
Where do we go
Sweet child o' mine

Welcome to the Jungle~
Welcome to the jungle
We've got fun 'n' games
We got everything you want
Honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey
We got your disease
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed
Welcome to the jungle
We take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed
But it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl
That's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get them for free
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream
Welcome to the jungle
It gets worse here everyday
Ya learn ta live like an animal
In the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see
You'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want
But you better not take it from me
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed
And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down, YEAH!
You know where you are
You're in the jungle baby
You're gonna die
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
knees, knees
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
knees, knees
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It's gonna bring you down-HA!

Where the Streets Have No Name~
I want to run
I want to hide
I want to tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I want to reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name
I want to feel sunlight on my face
See that dust cloud disappear without a trace
I want to take shelter from the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building
Then burning down love, burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you ....
It's all I can do
The cities a flood
And our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Still building
Then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
~
U2~
With or Without You~
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Slight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait....without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing left to win
And nothing else to lose
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

The Scotsman~
Oh, Scotsman clad in kilt left the bar one evening fair
One could tell by how he walked that he'd drunk more than his share
He staggered 'round until he could no longer keep his feet
And he stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street
Ring ding diddle iddle ah dee oh.. ring da diddlie aye oh..
He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.
About that time two young and lovely girls just happened by
One says to the other with a twinkle in her eye
See yon sleeping Scotsman, so strong and handsome built
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath their kilts
Ring ding diddle iddle ah dee oh.. ring da diddlie aye oh..
I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath their kilts.
They crept up on that sleeping Scotsman quiet as can be
Lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see
And there, behold, for them to view beneath his Scottish skirt
Was nothing more than god had graced him with upon his birth
Ring ding diddle iddle ah dee oh.. ring da diddlie aye oh..
Was nothing more than god had graced him with upon his birth.
They marveled for a moment then one said we must be gone
Let's leave a present for our friend before we move along
As a gift they left a blue silk ribbon tied into a bow
Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt did lift and show
Ring ding diddle iddle ah dee oh.. ring da diddlie aye oh.. 
Around the bonnie star the Scot's kilt did lift and show.
Now the Scotsman woke to nature's call and stumbled towards the trees
Behind a bush he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees
And in a startled voice he says, to what's before his eyes
Oh, lad I don't know where ye been, but I see ye won first prize!

Another One Bites the Dust~
Steve walks warily down the street,
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready, Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along,
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had,
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
You can treat him bad and then leave him when he's down
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

Pollyanna Flower~
Through you I see
Between a broken nose and a fake smile
Between the piety and gunpowder
Between the fighting and fleeing the scene
Between murder and diplomacy
Between agression and end of the odd
Between the brutal and realistically well behaved
Between the screaming and pulling in the reins
Between tiptoeing and ambling
What am I to do with all this fire
I'd like to hate you but I'd never hate you
Why are you still with me in this red space
I'd like to slap you but I'd never slap you
Between violence and silently seething
Between my fists and my Pollyanna Flower
Between fuck you in your face and its all right
Between war and denial
Between violence and silently seething
Between my fists and my Pollyanna Flower
Between fuck you to your face and its all right
Between war and denial
Between flying vases and secretly weeping
Between loose cannons and ever downplaying
Between the bruises and rudely differing
Between bursting and boiling
What am I to do with all this burning
I'd like to hurt you but I'd never hurt you
Do I overwhelm you in this place
I'd like to kill you but I'd never kill you
Between violence and silently seething
Between my fists and my Pollyanna Flower
Between fuck you to your face and it's all right
Between war and denial
Between violence and silently seething
Between my fists and my Pollyanna Flower
Between fuck you to your face and it's all right
Between war and denial
What am I to do with all this fire
Can you understand me in this place?

Collective Soul~
Crowded Head~
All the words that I want to hear
Are distorted by your weaknesses and fear
And your lies that I push away
I might accept them on your good self pity day
All of your sadness is crowded in my head
All of your madness is crowded in my head
And the peace that I really need
You substitute it for your policy of greed
Still your pride always suffocates
Any truth that your heart might want to make
All of your sadness is crowded in my head
All of your madness is crowded in my head
With all your static
I can't distinguish between what's being said
I have no room for this
You see I'm living with a crowded head
And the path that I needed shown
You left me stranded in the darkness all alone
All the promises you fed to me
I'm choking from their taste of cruelty
All of your sadness is crowded in my head
All of your madness is crowded in my head.

Sara Evans~
I could not ask for more~
Lying here with you
Listening to the rain
Smiling just to see the smile upon your face
These are the moments I thank God that Im alive
These are the moments Ill remember all my life
I found all Ive waited for
And I could not ask for more
Looking in your eyes
Seeing all I need
Everything you are is everything to me
These are the moments
I know heaven must exist
These are the moments I know all I need is this
I have all I've waited for
And I could not ask for more
I could not ask for more than this time together
I could not ask for more than this time with you
Every prayer has been answered
Every dream I has come true
And right here in this moment is right where Im meant to be
Here with you here with me
These are the moments I thank God that Im alive
These are the moments Ill remember all my life
Ive got all Ive waited for
And I could not ask for more
