   +=============================================+{x
 
{BCeleDi{x
The Blue Moon and Goddess of Purity and the Soul
CeleDi ruled the Mental Circle. She created the
mortal mind and gave him reason. Without her,
mortals could not exist as higher intelligence. She
doesn't direct mortal thought, but rather guides
with a loving hand. A very peaceful deity, in search
of harmony amongst mortals.
 
{BMing-Dao{x
God of Martial Arts and Heavenly Teacher
Ming-Dao serves under her, though not far. Creating
the consciousness of mortals was quite the task, so
Ming-Dao picks up the slack and helps mortals learn
how to wield such massive power.
 
{BRudah{x
Lord of Temptation
Rudah was not a local god of Alanthia. Being the
playful chap he is, he stopped by Alanthia to cause
trouble while cruising the universe. He found it so
much fun to upset Ming-Dao by tempting the mortals
into booze, wine, merriment, and other atrocities, that
he decided to take residence in Alanthia.
 
{rNikos{x
The Red Moon, God of War and Destruction
Nikos, god of war, destruction and flesh, rules the
physical circle. He created the mortal body as mere
toys to amuse himself. Of course, CeleDi saw this as
a great opportunity, and hence, pissed Nikos off
something bad by giving them free-will. Though, this
isn't to say Nikos doesn't hold any control. On the
contrary -- he just can't FORCE a mortal to do
anything, he must persuade them to do it in free will.
A fun game for Nikos, but it often tries his patience.
Nikos of the Flesh, is a man capable of great evils -
far more than any other god in Alanthia.
 
{rByziana{x
Goddess of Change and the Tides
Byziana, goddess of change and the tides, serves
under Nikos, at least to Nikos's beliefs. At times,
Byziana despises the destruction Nikos causes. But, she
realizes that destruction is part of the eternal cycle of
change. She pushes for change, and this is reflected in
the tides, the seasons, and Alanthia. One of the two
gods fused in the creation of Alanthia, she is part of
the planet.
 
{rKazimain{x
Holy Mother of Alanthia
Kazimain, mother to mortals, helped create Alanthia for
the mortal form to exist. She is now, in fact, synthesized
into the land. A truly benevolent deity, she balances out
the evil of Nikos. The land will never be harmed when
she is closely watching. Being so kind, she blessed the
mortals with medicine by creating certain herbs and
extracts upon the surface of Alanthia.
 
{rDidimus{x
the Father of Technology, Smithy to the Gods
Didimus was not a deity when Alanthia was created.
Instead, he was raptured into the heavens by proving
his worth to Nikos. A craftsman, he gave mortals
weapons. The Father of Technology, he proves vital
in Nikos's continuing struggle to pull mortals from the
cursed "enlightenment" that CeleDi blessed them with.
Basically a slave, but a deity none the less, he is adored
by all the gods for such devotion and hard work.
 
{WSahma{x
The Silver Moon, Goddess of Mystics
Sahma is the Creator of Dreams, and Distributor
of Wishes. Dreams in Alanthia are not mental, but are
mystical and, as a result, are controlled by her. Probably
the strongest of all the Moons, she is closely watched
and tempered by the thoughtful hand of Sadiq. Although
Sadiq took magic from the mortals as a result of the
Great Wars, Sahma has succeeded in returning magic to
Alanthia by the hands of Aiden.

"They are much more mature now," continued Sadiq, "though this isn't
to say there won't be wars an problems and people that shouldn't be
allowed to use it, but we think it's time for them to reclaim their
magical abilities. We fear they may need it one day."
 
"And it is your responsibility," Nikos interjected, "to assure that
they get the magic, and are trained, much like Ming-Dao has done for
you."
 
Aidan, still flabbergasted, smiled, retracted the smile to a frown,
then fell into thought as he said, "Thank you, I will do my best."
 
Ming-Dao chuckled, "Your best, is now godly. You'll do fine."
 
Aidan smiled, held it a little longer, and then fell silent.
 
          ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
~

growth2~
Opening his eyes, Aidan was no longer alone. The Planets, Ming-Dao,
Byziana, Kazimain, and Sadiq stood in a giant circle around him. Panic
almost grabbed him when CeleDi touch his shoulder and calmed him.
 
"Prepare yourself quickly, Aidan."
 
Wild thoughts raced through his mind as to what they meant. But, he
shook it off, drawing from the remnants of CeleDi's touch, and nodded
at them.
 
In the circle around him, they, in unison, raised their arms to the
sky. And in a flash, brought them down pointing directly at Aiden. A
quick, sharp pain rushed through Aidan's body. His soul was on fire.
He fell over in agony and passed to blackness.
 
Fluttering his eyelids, Aidan awoke to a room full of his town's
people. They had rushed to his temple, he figured, when they heard his
scream. Sitting up, he realized that no one was paying any attention to
him, even though he was obviously passed out on the floor. As he rose
to his feet, he took quick note of a new lightness in his step that he
had never felt. As he walked up to the one of the townspeople, they
still paid no attention. He waved a hand in front of their face, and
still no response. 
 
A new panic rushed through him. They couldn't see him! He must be a
dead! A ghost of sorts! Then he became aware that someone WAS
looking at him. Ming-Dao stood in the corner. At a lightning pace,
Aidan made his way to him. As he got to him, he bursted out in
feverent talk, asking Ming-Dao if he was dead?
 
Ming-Dao let out a hearty laugh, "Quite the opposite my Dear Aidan."
 
"Th.. th.. then wh... wh.. what's happend? Who were those people?"
 
"They were the other Gods of Alanthia, Aidan. They're the reason this
planet exists, and the reason you can have this conversation right now."
 
Nodding, Ming-Dao explained the basics of how this world came about.
 
"And Aidan, because you are the only mortal left who wants to believe
that there are Gods and Magic in Alanthia -- you have been blessed."
 
"Blessed? Is that why I feel a bounce in my step and I tingle every
time I take a step?"
 
Ming-Dao nodded, "Indeed, but that's not even a fraction on what
you've been given."
 
Aidan seemed confused.
 
"Take my hand, Aidan." He did, and they walked outside into a field.
"They cannot see you my friend, because that's the way it is when you
first become...." Trailing off with Aidan on his every word, Ming-Dao
rose off the ground into the clouds. Aidan was panicked at first, but
felt at ease with Ming-Dao. Then, Ming-Dao let go of his hand.
Falling quickly, Aidan raced towards the ground, feet first. Instinct
grabbed Aidan, and he reached out to grab anything he could, though he
knew there was nothing. A whisper entered Aidan's ear, "You're a God
now." Aidan was so flustered that he almost dismissed it for the wind,
but decided he'd better try it out, or eat the rapidly approaching
ground.
 
With a mighty push, Aidan stared at the ground and bid it not come
closer. And it did. It slowly stopped approaching him, and Aidan
realized that he was floating in mid-air. Smiling and laughing, Aidan
soared back into the sky to Ming-Dao. "Thank you! Thank you,
Ming-Dao!"
 
"It isn't me alone you should thank."
 
"The others?" Aidan asked referring to the others that he had seen in
the circle around him.
 
"Indeed, lets go see them." And with that, Ming-Dao shot into the
atmosphere of Alanthia and Aidan followed. out of the atmosphere and
into space, Aidan halted immediately and fell into instantaneous
prayer. The planetary skyline and the three mighty moons where so
close, and so beautiful.
 
Nikos's voice boomed through the air with a slight chuckle, "Raise,
Aidan. I am flattered that you still pray, but it is not necessary
-- you are a God."
 
Aidan, red in the face, stood in the nothingness of space to face
Nikos and the other two planets.
 
"Of course," spoke Sahma, "the greatest gift of all comes with a
price."
 
"Indeed," continued Sadiq, "I have chosen you, because of your
patience, wisdom, and commitment to your heart and religion, to play
a large part in Alanthia's future."
 
"We want you to bring magic back to Alanthia, Aidan."
 
"Magic," spoke a trembling Aidan, "like the Great War magic?"
 
Sadiq paused, thinking, and then replied, "Yes."
 
Seeing the painful anxiety on Aidan's face, CeleDi stepped in, "But
it won't be the same. *YOU* won't let it."

the growth~
With Alanthia in its adolescence, the moons sat back and watched
time unfold. Unfortunately, the young races of Alanthia were not
prepared for everything that the moons threw upon them.
 
The most important, was the magic Sahma granted the mortals was
wreaking pure havoc. The unskilled and underdeveloped races wielded
the massive powers like a child with a new toy. They instantly created
huge cities of magnificent splendor, but lacked the mentality to govern
such an estate. Thus, many of the Great Cities perished into the fertile
soils of Alanthia.
 
The great chaos within the cities only lead to the Great Wars. Every
intelligent being was unsafe in these times. Magic flew rampant, and
if you didn't get fried by a skewed lightning bolt, you were lucky.
Ming-Dao tried in vein to teach the mortals, but you can't teach a
world of children how not to play with toys before they destroy
themselves with them.
 
From high in orbit, the moons could see the wars below like great
fireworks, lighting the atmosphere in brilliant magical colors.
Unfortunately, the beauty was undermined by the mass death. Sadiq
was the first to take action. And his plan was simple -- remove
magic from Alanthia. And thus, he cast an invisible shell over the
whole of Alanthia that nulled any spell cast.
 
And peace, of sorts, returned to Alanthia. The people stopped
warring, because they needed to learn how to farm and build, rather
than kill. The magic in the atmosphere halted, and the days and
nights returned to just that.
 
In time, the magic was forgotten, and all that was remember was
the "Great Wars", when the skies flashed and sparked day and night
and chaos reigned supreme. It was a time no one wanted to remember.
 
However, there was one soul on Alanthia who wanted to. Aidan was
his name and he was a very meticulous and beautiful scribe. A priest
of the old religion, he preached daily on the Great Wars, and how
magic once existed. However, very few still believed in magic. At
first, it's not that people didn't believe, it's that they blocked it out.
And as the generations rolled on, it became nothing more than a myth.
 
Ming-Dao, on the planet's surface, continued to teach to press into
higher levels of consciousness for the people. He became renowned by
the people, and considered him a holy man. Ming-Dao, of course, never
revealed his true nature -- that he was indeed a god. This was key in
training, because he wanted them to find their own way and truth, not
adopt his on "godly" principle.
 
In fact, Aidan had made a pilgrimage one year to study under
Ming-Dao. While Aidan refused to learn the way of the martial arts,
he did accept the many words of wisdom that Ming-Dao offered.
 
One day, Aidan asked Ming-Dao, "Are you a God?"
 
Ming-Dao chuckled lightly, and asked, "Why would you think such a
thing, Aidan?"
 
"Because... I don't know, Master. I can just feel it."
 
Raising and eyebrow, Ming-Dao replied in a quiet, low voice, "Trust
that feeling."
 
Aidan smiled gratefully, and returned to his home town. Nearby, he
constructed a small temple. With painstaking detail, he hand-built
the entire temple by himself with small bricks. In the end, it was
a small structure filled with stain glass, but still not very
impressive. Only one of the four small walls were decorated. Paintings
of Ming-Dao were hung on the wall and many small, clay figurines of
Ming-Dao lay scattered around the floors. Aidan was a fine scribe
with excellent penmanship, but his clay works needed much improvement.
 
In this small temple to a person Aidan couldn't even prove was a god,
he prayed. With a figurine in each hand, Aidan chanted some words
Ming-Dao had taught him, but nothing ever happened.
 
A few years later, Aidan was getting upset, and wondering if his gut
was wrong. he decided he'd try one last time. With the normal figurine
in each hand, he bowed before the painting and began chanting. Aiden
closed his eyes and thought of nothing. He cleared his mind.
 
Slowly, he lowered to one knee and set the figurines on the floor
beside him. When he rose back up, he spread his arms to every side
of him in a slow, intentional, sweeping movement. His words changed
from those that Ming-Dao had taught him to those he had heard once -
Trust yourself.

game2~
"Look over there, " he sputtered in bewilderment as
he spotted the "perfect" races that Sahma had found
earlier. Confused, both CeleDi and Nikos, made a
quick change to the perfection. Nikos took the
perfect Trolleins, as he called them, and beat
them into ugliness. It was enough to offend any
creature, and thus, Byziana pulled them into her
soil to hide their disgraceful bodies from the
world. CeleDi, with the aid of Ming-Dao, set out to
destroy the evil demons. Of course, destruction of
any race created was against the cosmic rules, so 
Ming-Dao decided that infertility would be the
easiest way to skirt this rule. He succeeded, but
not before they bred the demonspawn.
 
Sadiq, over looking this odd chain of events, decided
that the single actions of the Planets didn't balance
the perfection. So he turned the mighty gargoyle to
stone, to slow it's great speed. To the vampire, he
gave the gift of eternal hunger. Finally, he erased
the wraiths from this world as far as he could without
breaking the Cosmic Law of Extinction. Thus, they
became the translucent beings they are today.
 
All content, CeleDi continued with her rebuttal move.
Though an odd move, since she chose not to directly
change any of the races, she bid Ming-Dao to teach
the many races how to wield their free will wisely.
Graciously, Ming-Dao accepted the position, and
prepared for his descent to Alanthia, his new home.
 
As soon as CeleDi was done speaking, Sahma threw
the biggest wrench into the gears of Alanthia -- Magic.
Adding the chaos that resulted was the last move, and
the game closed.
 
"Thank you Planets," spoke Sadiq thoughtfully, "May
the choices you made not destroy Alanthia."
 
Nikos giggled.
 
CeleDi slapped him.
 
Sahma fell silent.
 
Byziana and Kazimain prayed.

the game~
The Planets stood silent staring at the revolving mass
and in unison let out a deep sigh as if saying, "Wow."
 
A world of great beauty now lay before them.
This realization first dawned on Nikos, who smiled like
a devilish, little child. An entire world to mold into
his ideals! What a true blessing this event was!
Unfortunate for him, CeleDi wasn't far behind, and she
too, began planning.
 
The great Game had begun and even the mighty Sahma
plotted her strategic movements.
 
As would be expected, Sadiq planned how to handle the
mass hysteria that the planets were about to unleash
upon the virgin soils of Alanthia. He quickly decided
his means of mediation.
 
He instructed each planet to choose a comet of their
liking. Nikos, CeleDi, and Sahma each quickly search
the near universe for suitable comets, knowing what
Sadiq had in mind. Each handed their comet of choice
to Sadiq who simply smiled.
 
With blinding speed, Sadiq spun in tight circles holding
each comet by their tail. A flick of his wrist and a
mighty grunt, the comets were sent into a high speed
velocity around the Sun. The Planets began cheering in
amazing decibels! The comets roared past the Sun and
began their elliptical path back towards the planets.
Nikos's comet was the first to come roaring by
Alanthia with CeleDi's in close second. Poor Sahma's
comet was a good month behind which extremely
perturbed her.
 
After the race was finalized, Sadiq gave Nikos a slight
nod. Nikos now had first choice as to what to add to
Alanthia.
 
Nikos quickly grabbed his blueprints and began carving
life into Alanthia. His pawns were quickly positioned as
mindless creatures without will, prepared to serve
Nikos. With a great cackle he forged the humanoids to
rule the great cities of deceit. With a smirk, he
molded the elves to help him conquer the mighty
forests of Alanthia. Finally, he placed the Darviers
upon the great lands of Alanthia. Though he
originally intended to put them under the ground,
Byziana had other words and would not allow him
to penetrate her soils with his spawn.
 
With Nikos complete, it was CeleDi's turn. To
counter Nikos's pawns, she gave each creature Nikos
created free will. Nikos growled at himself for
leaving himself so open to such a counter-attack.
Of course, CeleDi was delighted and smiled at Nikos,
gloating.
 
Now, Sahma, still upset that her comet was lame,
prepared to create her own visions on Alanthia when
something strange caught her eye. She saw creatures
roaming the surfaces of Alanthia that neither CeleDi
nor Nikos had created. These creatures appeared
perfect. This could not be the work of any of the
planets, because their vibration was much higher
than anything they could have created. Puzzled,
she scratched her head.
 
"Sahma," Sadiq spoke, "perhaps you would like to
pass your opportunity to Nikos? I'm sure he'd enjoy
another turn."
 
"Oh, sorry." Sahma absent mindedly replied as she
quickly decided to keep this observation to herself.
With a slight hand gesture, Alanthia was blessed
with the magical fairy-folk -- independent of CeleDi
or Nikos, they had their own consciousness that
allowed them the magical powers of the Silver Moon.
Of course, Sahma had not forgotten that she was
humiliated in the comet race. She quietly sneaked
to the Isle of Omichle and created the mighty dragon!
"Maybe that will scare Nikos's and CeleDi's toys to
death!" she silently screamed.
 
Sadiq once again smiled, and told the Planets that they
were each allowed one rebuttal move and then Alanthia
would be complete.
 
Nikos quickly jumped at the opportunity and threw
some of his fiery, red self into the land of
Alanthia. This was an attempt to make the darviers
begin their borrow into the ground of Alanthia,
and of course, to spite Byziana's wishes.
 
CeleDi, happy that he hadn't created too much of a
commotion, was about to make her move, when Nikos
stopped her.

Inspired by the whole thing, CeleDi summoned the
purest of loves. Her beautiful shores stood
strong as the wave of her emotional waters
pummeled them. Hurricanes began to arise, and
typhoons became commonplace on CeleDi's surface.
She was pulling the energy's of the cosmos
together, preparing to douse the energy mass
with it.
 
Sahma smiled brightly, and Sadiq nodded
knowingly. With a splendid display of colors,
Sahma opened her silvery surface to reveal her
revered inner core. The prismatic effect split
the incoming light and spun it in every which
direction. Everything appeared to be in pure
chaos! Nikos and CeleDi were feeding energy
into the lands. Sahma was carving the newly
forged lands with the highly concentrated
prismatic rays of Star light. Kazimain and
Byziana were somewhere in the middle of it all.
 
Suddenly, the light intensified dramatically!
So much, that even the Moons had to pull away.
 
When the energy dissipated, in the middle of
the three moons stood a new planet. Hand
carved by them, by the blessings of the
Stars --- a new land was forged. The Moons
stood in awe. Never before had a Star been
salvaged from death. But had it been?
 
Looking closer, the planet seemed dead. It
wasn't spinning, it wasn't breathing, it was
nothing more than an asteroid. But then the
second miracle occurred.
 
Another flash of bright light, but this time,
it wasn't just a flash. It was two small Stars
whizzing directly by the Moons and this new
land. Without a single noise, the two stars
slipped together to created one substantial
star. As the first ray from the new Star
touched the planet's surface, it began to
revolve. Slowly it awoke, and Kazimain and
Byziana yawned as they shook their leaves and
stirred the tides.
 
"Welcome Moons, " spoke the planet in familiar
voices. "Welcome to Alanthia, Land of Three Moons."
 
           ++++++++++++++++++++++

the creation~
A faint twinkle; emptiness; yet so alive.
 
A gentle sigh echoed through the vastness.
 
Quietly, CeleDi began to cry. She could feel the
pain and hell that the giant weeper was forced to
sustain. Every second of the death throws tore at
her soul and shook her to her core. "Why would the
Stars allow such a thing?" she pondered over and
over again.
 
Nikos answered, "Do not worry yourself, sweet
CeleDi. The Stars know what they are doing. They
are exacting in a chaotic way. We are not to know
their purposes, but they know perfectly well."
 
"Destruction, " Nikos continued, "is what the
universe was built upon!"
 
Half-heatedly, CeleDi retorted, "Why must we argue
this point again? You, yourself, just said that you
cannot know, yet you claim to be so sure."
 
About to fan the flames, Nikos was quickly
interrupted, "Nikos, hold your tongue! I grow
tired of such banter," said Sahma as she laid
down the authority. "It is so amazing how a single
dying star, of which we've seen and heard over a
trillion in our existence, can excite your souls so!"
 
A quiet voice whispered, "Of course we do."
 
"Would you care to elaborate Miss Kazimain?" prodded
Sahma.
 
"If you please M'lady," and Kazimain explains:
 
"The Stars are the universe. Without them, we have no
path, we have no light. Nothing. They guide us, they
show us the way. Not directly, but through their
heavenly light, we see a glimpse of them, reflected
off of everything. Don't you see? We ARE them. We
are nothing more than a reflection of the Soul of
the Stars."
 
Standing calmly upon the vast oceans of CeleDi,
Kazimain felt the energy flow through her body.
She had felt it many times before. Dying stars seem
to sense her, and they know that she understand. It
is because of this that they channel their last
dying energies into her, and not the other Gods.
A giant ripple cascaded out from the water she
stood upon as she gazed out into the great silver
skies, and turned to the Silver Moon of the Trinity,
Sahma.
 
"Can you feel it Sahma?" Kazimain questioned.
 
Sahma shook her head and said quietly, "No. I cannot."
 
"Nikos, CeleDi, can you?" Both lowered their heads in
silence.
 
"It is too bad, it is a most amazing gift from the
Stars."
 
"I know that I cannot feel it, Kazimain, but I sense
that it flows through your veins. You have been
blessed by the Stars on this day Miss Kazimain. It
would be most erroneous to not put this gift to good
use," interjected the great teacher, Ming-Dao, who
up until now had only taken a half interest.
 
"I believe you are right, Sensei! As my gift, I
will give life to this dying star once again!"
Energy pulsed through her body, and the ripples
on CeleDi's waters grew into waves. Every God
scoffed and laughed, for everyone knew that a Star
could not be resurrected. It was against the laws
of the Cosmos, and was never allowed by the Stars.
 
"Perhaps you should not all be so hasty to jump to
conclusions," wisely spoke Sadiq. "and then perhaps
you should take a look at our dear friend."
 
Everyone turned to look upon a dying star, but it
was not collapsing. Amazed, everyone spun to see
Kazimain was now accompanied by Byziana. Both,
surrounded in a bright haze of white, glowing
energy, were directly in the middle of the three
Great Planets, Sahma, CeleDi, and Nikos. Byziana,
the Goddess of Change, had felt a chance to forge
new lands and turn new tides! She exercised her
powers well with the great powers of Kazimain's
love for this dying star. Together, they were
changing the flow of time and matter, and pumped
what energy the Stars had previously given Kazimain
back into the dying star. Even more amazing, sudden
intense beams of light radiated into the haze that
was growing denser around Kazimain by the second.
The lights were seemingly coming from everywhere:
every Star in the universe was focused here.
 
Shaking the befuddlement from their minds, the
planets gathered around the now growing mass that
had engulfed Kazimain and Byziana. Under Sadiq's
advice, they assisted in this unbelievable event.
 
With a great fury, Nikos ruptured his red soil and
forced his streams of blood to erupt in volcanic
ferocity. Spinning quickly, and gaining momentum,
he revolved the energy mass with blinding speed.
The Planet's blood soared from his atmosphere into
the mass. Slowly, it began to solidify.

Judge and Mediator
Sadiq is the Judge of Alanthia and its gods. Mostly,
he watches with a careful eye over the working of the
lands and heavens. As a result, he is often depicted
as having a hundred eyes. Upon death, it is Sadiq to
whom mortals must answer. Sadiq, also, is a very
different type of god. He is much more in touch with
the stars, and possibly once was one, or will
eventually become one. None of the Moons know the
answer, but Sadiq has traveled on Sahma's surface since
the beginning of her life. Often considered cold-hearted,
he knows more than he reveals and is the Keeper of
Wisdom.
 
{WAiden{x
The Devout, Deliverer of Magic
Aidan, like Didimus, was not an original Alanthian
deity. Instead, he was raptured under the direction
of Sahma. After the Great Wars, when Sadiq banned
magic from Alanthia for all the chaos it has created,
Aiden feverently continued his belief in, and devotion
to all the gods even though they too were absent from
Alanthia. As a reward, Sahma and the Moons deemed
him the Deliverer of Magic. He returned magic to the
mortals.

Rain poured down in a heavy, piercing blanket that cut and tore
the forest. Loud claps of thunder echoed a low growl through the
trees and brilliant flashes of lighting flashed and faded, plunging
the forest into hollow darkness. In the split seconds of light, one
could see two small shadows darting hastily for cover. The
shadows turned and caught sight of a hollow just large enough
for both of them nested within a gnarled, ancient tree.One figure
hoisted the smaller into the knot, where she collapsed, exhausted
and ill. The larger figure lagged behind...peering intently and
searching. The female, in the tree, fell into a fevered and hasty
slumber.
A blinding, burning explosion of heat and light caused the skin on
the female to prickle. She awoke alert and looked hastily for her
mate. Seconds later a loud ominous crash echoing with the sound
of the instant shattering of bones and bark filled the forest. Within moments, a horrifying scream broke loose and a potent
burning odor followed, sending the forest into chill shock. The
female froze, horrified.
The storm broke suddenly, leaving only a heavy rain that echoed
the female's mournful cries.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soft light filtered into the sylvan female's small haven. She
awoke, her pale face stained with tears and her long auburn hair
wet with rain and sobbing. She peered curiously out the hollow.
Her vision was assailed with the sight of a scarred and injured
forest. Soft rays of sunlight radiated through the canpoy. Her
emerald green eyes gazed mournfully. Under the broken and
splintered remains of a tree she saw the torn and mutilated body
of her mate. She turned from the ghastly scene in sorrowful
resolution and fell asleep.
Hours later, she awoke from her restless slumber, the pain in her
heavy abdomen renewed. She sat up in sobbing pain. How could
she go through child-birth alone? How would her child live without
the father? She cried out in pain, her misery echoing through the
empty forest. A soft scent of pine and greens suddenly permeated
her senses and lulled her into a peaceful sleep.
She dreamed of the spirits speaking to her. They spoke of her child...
wait, her children. Two daughters. They told her each would
follow holy paths and each was destined to be of different
elements. She felt calm and relaxed. The spirits would guide and
care for her children. She awoke with two small pale bundles
nestled in each arm. One was wrapped in an emerald leaf and the
other in a blanket of the purest blue. She named the one in green
Shoshara, and the other Rhiannanon.
Shoshara dashed lightly through the emerald green forest. Streams
of light radiated and casted heavenly glows on the forest floor.
Shoshara inhaled the fresh crisp air and pine scent happily. She
loved the forest, the trees and animals and plants, the fresh air,
and the protection and shelter offered. She continued to run until
she arrived at a circular grove of oaks and hemlocks.
She said a brief prayer to the spirits and entered. She removed her
velvet cloak and kneeled upon the grove floor. She took out
several vials and flasks, took a small sip from each and oiled her
pale hands and face with a few. She finished her preparations and
stared up toward the sun radiating down upon her. She began to
pray and mediate to the spirits of her forest.
Her childhood had been a quiet and lonely one, with only the
forest and her family as companions, but what grand companions
they were. Shoshara and Rhiannanon were best of friends until
they were separated. When she reached 10 cycles of age, the
forest reclaimed their own and spirited Shoshara away to the holy
grove to be taught the holy ways of the spirits. She learned well
and quickly, reaching the end of her training in only 7 years.
Upon her dismissal from tutelage, she remained in the forest,
longing to remeet her mother and sister. Eventually she resolved
to leave the forest to which she had grown so attached and
joined the ranks of main-stream Alanthian society. She had even
held high-rank as a leader of Selohaar and was a respected healer
and leader through her quiet strength and wisdom. But still, she
felt unfulfilled and incomplete. Some essential part of her was
missing, something she had in her forest home. She thought back
to her teachings and her birth and resolved to return to the grove
she where she learned her calling. The spirits she had always loved
and worshiped would guide her, for they had guided her through

{x    I was swept up in the demon fire, pain from my wound too intense for 
me  to breathe. I fainted then, and when I woke, I was lying in a temple 
in  a land known as Midgaard. I was naked, covered in blood and fearing 
for my life. In a pit by the altar I found a dagger, and cut into my flesh, 
removed the charm that my aunt had placed there. A crow whom I had 
befriended came to my side and asked if he could help. I gave him the 
charm, which he consumed and flew away. He knew to never return to the 
grove, and he would not want to. That was one problem solved -- my aunt 
would never be able to use her device to find me. I could only hope she 
had enough trust in the charm to not use her other senses, which would 
alert her to my presence if she could listen to them.
{x
{x    I began to learn the ways of the mage, feeling I may have need for 
strong  protection, should my aunt ever find me. My mother came to me in 
my  visions, with my father, happy. She warned me to avoid the grove at 
all costs... she showed me glimpses of the future of that place.

{x    Meanwhile, my mother threw herself into her religion. She spent hours
upon hours each day in meditation, and I knew my father must come to her 
to comfort her as well. The people of the Grove loved her, and she was a
wonderful advisor to them. I spent most of my time in the woods, in the 
trees, learning their secrets. My father taught me that one has only to 
listen to know the truths in the world, and he taught me to listen to 
everything. Even the rocks have stories to tell!
{x
{x    Before I reached my 16th birthday, the new Acolyte at the chapel had 
asked my mother for my hand in marriage. He knew I would not be available 
until I was 18, but he gave me a cold feeling when I met  him. My mother 
told him I could make my own decision. I went out one night with him, Azra 
was his name, into the grove to show him my favorite tree. I could hear in 
his breath the decay within...I could sense he was not what he seemed. I 
spoke with him at length. Azra told me he was outcast because he would not 
kill, he lived with demons, evil Elvenkind who wanted him to become one of 
them. He fled to us for sanctuary. I knew he was lying. I told him that I 
would  consider his offer and went home to my mother. I heard the truth in
his voice -- he was told to woo me, for he was quite handsome, and marry 
me so he could become the High Priest. My mother had him investigated, but 
quietly, and found him worshipping Nikos in the quiet of his room. Azra, 
his cover removed, turned into the flames of hell itself and vanished into
the night. He was a demon sent, but by who? My dreams were uneasy, but I 
had not the gift of seeing within them. My mother, too, slept shallowly 
for a time. Perhaps she saw what was to come next.
{x
{x    Scarcely three moon cycles had passed when, while meditating in my 
bedchamber, I sensed a disturbance coming from the chapel where my mother
and father were wed. I ran to investigate, but it was too late. When I got
there, my beautiful mother was lying on the steps before the altar, my 
father's robe in her hands. Blood flowed like a river from her, coating 
the steps. She moaned a final moan, and with that, the wind entered the 
chapel and swept her up like a feral tide.
{x
{x    My mother was gone. I will never forget the horror I felt upon seeing 
the river of blood. It soaked the hem of my robe and gown. The smell was 
thick in the air, and the wind screamed in unison with me.
{x
{x    A tall woman in a black robe circled from behind me.
{x
{x    "Dex..." she said, her voice deeper than any I'd heard. I heard 
thousands of shrieking voices inside that one word. I froze, unable to 
move.
{x
{x    "You've turned out to be as lovely as your mother, my little one. Come 
closer."
{x
{x    I had no choice! I had to obey her... my legs moved as though I'd no 
will of my own. She removed my robe -- I felt her cold hands touch my 
untouched flesh. I shrank back from it, feeling my nerves pull away from 
my flesh in an attempt to flee. She took a knife from her robe and moved \
in close  to me, her breath hissing in my ear. "Now, my beautiful child... 
listen to me, and listen well, for this is but a warning. I want you to 
leave this place, leave this grove. You are no longer the Crown Priestess. 
You are no longer welcome here. With this charm," she plucked a piece of 
metal from a pocket of her robe, "I will know when you are nearby. I will 
see your movements, and you cannot escape from me. I care not where you go, 
but you are not to return to this grove!"
{x
{x    The point of her knife pierced my flesh at my navel. White-hot pain 
flared up, searing my skin from navel to breasts. My blood fell in 
rivulets, joining my mothers, and I sobbed as the woman embedded the 
trinket in my skin.
{x
{x    "We are family, you and I," she said, watching me as I dropped to my 
knees on the floor, sobbing. "Your mother was my sister. Poor, dear 
sister."
{x
{x    Demons appeared on either side of her. I knew her name was Lenore 
without being told, as my mother's consciousness enveloped me. I saw their 
childhood together, I saw the points that even my mother did not see, 
Lenore's love for my father, Lenore's jealousy that she would never have 
a child. Lenore raised her hands to the sky and the demons settled at 
her feet, their black eyes glaring at me.

{x    Sharni was a beautiful Sylvan maiden, the Crown Priestess of the 
Grove. Sharni was from the line of women who became the High Priestess of
the Grove, in each generation. The mother would train the daughter until 
it came time for the mother to step down and spend the rest of her life 
in the forest, playing and rejoicing in the wisdom given to all creatures
by CeleDi. Each Priestess was ordered to have only one girl child, and 
that girl child would gain all the wisdom of those who preceded her in 
the family line. Corrine, Sharni's mother, made a grievous mistake. She 
bore a second daughter, one year after Sharni was born. Lenore, the 
second, was not what a Sylvan should be. She was tall, nearly 6 feet 
tall, and dark of hair, light bronze of skin. She had none of the earthen
beauty of her sister. Lenore had a dark voice, and she did not learn as 
quickly as Sharni. Still, the sisters loved each other, and spent all 
their time together, in studies or in play. As they grew older, they began
to grow apart, as time will make enemies out of friends and lovers, so 
Lenore became resentful of Sharni. As Sharni grew older, her beauty 
became her mark, and was praised in every kingdom, by the tongue of anyone
who had seen her. Lenore found herself hiding in the corners, watching 
Sharni, who was the Crown Priestess, basking in the glow of the sun and 
the confidence that comes from inner peace. At 18, Sharni had the world 
at her feet. In a few short years, she would take her mother's place as 
the High Priestess, and all the creatures of the grove would rejoice in 
her kindness and wisdom. She fell in love with an Acolyte, Athalan, the 
son of a noble Sylvan from a nearby realm. He was brilliant, filled with
creativity and intelligence that Sharni recognized as worthy of the High
Priest. Their love was a love that bore songs and legends. When they were
wed in the small chapel in the grove, every man, woman, child, and 
creature came to see them become one. The grove was filled with a holy 
light, calm and serene, and the presence of CeleDi was felt by all.
{x
{x    Except for one. Lenore sat, watching the ceremony from the dark corner.
She, too, fell in love with Athalan. She, too, felt he would belong to 
her and she to him.He had not betrayed Sharni, his love, but Lenore felt
that she would win him in the end. When his engagement to Sharni was 
announced, Lenore felt that her heart had been torn from her chest. Her 
hope was gone, and within her, jealousy began to fester and breed.
{x
{x    Years passed and Sharni gave birth to a baby girl, Dex, Crown Priestess 
of the Grove. Lenore saw the birth of Dex and said a blessing over the 
baby. The rite of blessing was the last time anyone saw Lenore. She 
vanished, seemingly without a trace.

{x    I grew up, the much coddled baby, only child of High Priestess Sharni
and High Priest Athalan. My mother was lovely, hair the embodiment of 
fire, eyes the emerald of the grass and leaves, skin the color of the
earth. She moved with the willowy grace of the wind, and could beckon it 
to rock me gently in my cradle of ivy. Nightly I was sung to by the wind 
and the trees, the leaves bent to protect me from the rains. I grew in
love, this way, with my father and mother to keep me safe. They taught me 
of the legends, taught me how to follow the path of CeleDi, like my fair 
mother. I began to resemble her, both in grace and in thought. I thought
to become a cleric, and learn the art of healing.My father, deep in 
meditation one night, did not notice the earthquake in the small cave that
crushed the life out of him. I knew he felt no pain, for he came to me in
a vision that night, to calm my tears and tell me I must be strong, for my
mother's sake. He was with me, from that point on, Athalan. He guides my
movements, and it is to him I turn in meditations. He showed me realms of 
the gods that no mortal could see, mere glimpses. Like shadows playing in 
a mirror. Enough to let me know he was well and exploring, and that was
all I needed. He died when I was 11, but became my closest advisor as 
well.

{x 
{x    In an age long forgotten by man, there existed a large empire. 
It was a veritable paradise, all that lived there lived happily. 
Of course there were some that this empire didn't much matter to,
and there were still others that would rather see it destroyed. In
an age before the clans that walk now were considered there existed 
the Nightlords.
{x
{x    Karn al'Thetus led these troops against this empire time and again. 
Nobody could quite remember why, but many thought the lord of it 
had wronged Karn in the past. And each time his troops were repelled. 
It was then that he created the Nightlords. He didn't really want 
such evil on his side, they say. He just wanted revenge. The magics 
he worked with and the dealings for the Nightlords' power warped Karn 
they say. He wanted his revenge alright. He wanted it no longer on
the empire, he wanted it on all that lived, all that had the gift 
of life he gave up for his power.
{x
{x    It was then the lord of the empire of Avanil decided he too needed 
troops. His seeking for powers to match Karn's own warped him in a 
much different way however. He too lost his life, but he in turn lost
his physical body. And so the wraith of lord Derrin of Avanil went 
before his people, displaying his power, goading them into defending 
their homes. Few revolted, even fewer knew what became of them.
{x
{x    And so fits in Adrian. He had lived in Avanil all his life. Unmarried, 
no family to raise, he joined Derrin's army, seeing nothing better to 
do. He took what he had with him, a meager living, shouldered Blaize. 
A family heirloom, this sword was known around the world as a slayer 
of evil as well as pretty much anything else. He showed up on Derrin's 
front porch and joined the wraithlord's legions.
{x
{x    Adrian rose in the ranks, mercilessly slaughtering all opposed to his 
lord, earning the rank of Grand General. And all knew those he killed,
the mutilated bodies rent in the wake of Blaize. Yeah, he thought. This 
is how life is...
{x
{x    Then Karn showed his prowess. He rose the dead of both sides. Derrin 
faced his own troops, fighting in the ranks of Karn's own. The Vampire 
lord's legions of undead rose as the shade lord knew his time had come. 
He brought his power together, drawing the souls of his own warriors 
into Wraiths to fight the bodies they had once lived in. The seige of 
Avanil had begun and time meant nothing to the two that fought it. They 
both stood ready, prepared for combat when the first of either broke
the strain of self control and attacked.
{x
{x    Adrian had no such compunctions...or patience. He wanted this war 
done, so he could enjoy the easy life agian. He stole out under the cover 
of darkness and hunted Karn himself. He invaded the warlord's tent, 
creeping unto his sleeping form of his enemy. Vampires however...need very 
little sleep. Adrian drew Blaize, ready to finish this for good...and 
looked straight into the burning holes that were the eyes of Karn al'Thetus.
{x
{x    Adrian never found out how that war ended. He never saw what became of 
Karn and himself. It was on a dusty plain that he awoke, dust in his eyes
that was not felt. He pushed to his knees, the rocks and dust tearing 
into his hand where no blood ran. He saw Blaize, sheathed, laying some
feet away at his side. He reached for it and then knew what had become 
of him. He had not a recollection of the war because he had died in it.
Karn had used him. To what end he knew not, but it did not matter now. 
He knew not how much time had passed, why he had become a vampire, like
Derrin instead of Karn, or why his own hand could not touch Blaize. 
However, he had the sword, and he shouldered it, unable to remove it,
adjusted his rusted, worn substandard armor, and set off to a land that 
had changed.
{x
{x    From the land of Avanil he had known, loved and served, came another 
land. Alanthia. Perhaps he could make the most of this little trick Karn
had done he thought, as he he strode into the town of Midgaard. But for 
now, I think I need a light snack...
{x
{x    Nobody is quite certain of Adrian's current motives. It seems as though
he means to make amends, but he is, after all in Tempest. Deeply. Perhaps 
he cannot be trusted, perhaps he can be so with more than is imaginable. 
Perhaps he just wants you wondering, looking over your shoulder at your 
hungry new friend.

Ethans beginnings started in a small forest town called Charmain. 
Charmain was a thriving peaceful Sprite village that had been around 
for years. Ethan was born the younger brother of Enigma, who was
already 4 years older. Ethans parents were prominent and very noble 
members of the city of Charmain. His father was a high-ranking council
official, and his mother was a member of the Royal Family that faded 
out years ago. She stayed at home keeping care of the children. Ethan
was usually off playing with his good friend, Cololhe. His sister 
had already begun learning the arts of a thief. One day, just a few 
weeks after Ethan began studing ways of the magi, he and Cololhe 
ventured off to the woods.
{x
"Ethan, Ethan," called Cololhe as the two sprites wandered through
the deep dark forest. "Wait up."
{x
They were on a journey to a cathedral where, for several years, they
had prayed to their holy gods. The catherdral had been abandoned for
years and was covered in growth from the forest. When they approached
the cathedral they suddenly felt as though something was
drastically different. As they ventured to the altar where they
had prayed they saw movements of horrible creatures in the shadows
but thought nothing of it. Ethan led as they approached the altar
of pure gold and silver. When they knelt to the altar, Ethan heard
a terrible scream wreaking of death. He turned and saw, in horror, the
dismbodied parts of his once best friend. Rising at the speed of
lightning Ethan drew his sword and was ready for battle. When he
turned to see what had killed his friend he saw nothing. Nothing 
was in within the presence of Ethan. At that second he heard the
most horrible and terrible voice emminating from a hell spawned creature
and damning Ethan into evil forevermore.
{x
Not shortly after, mayhap three weeks, a group of orcs and warlocks
swept through the city and killed all but a few. This was the same
group that had massacred the nearby human city of Gorges Fall.
Both Ethan and Enigma were left with few others. They took
their separate ways -- both the pure embodiment of evil.
{x
Seven years passed before the to siblings were to see each other
again. From then on they have kept good contact with each other.
Even with evil tainted across his heart, there is an inkling of
good in him, but barley enough to return to his former self.

"Cyriclasn'bael"
{x
A voice whispered through the blackness. Centuries upon
centuries have passed since sound had been heard.
{x
"Cyric," the voice spoke again, using his more common
name.
{x
The beast finally opened his eyes after his age long slumber.
{x
"What do you wish of me?"
{x
"Your time has come, Great One. Your destiny is upon
you. The Ancient Gods of Alanthia have fled, leaving the
Younger Gods of the Three Moons to rule. The time is
coming, Lord, and I've been sent to awaken you."
{x
The Black Wyrm remained motionless, surrounded by the
immense walls of his mountain cavern, mulling over this 
welcome news. "How did you get in here? My home had
been sealed by the Ancient Ones, never to be reopened
while they remained in power. My slumber was much the
same, induced by them to keep me from attaining my 
goals."
{x
"Aye, Lord. The Master of my order transported me here
by magical means. He sent me here to awaken you and offer
the order's support in your cause." The young man was
getting nervous, his eyes shifting from the great red 
eyes of the Dragon before him to the amazing wealth of
Ancient Magic surrounding him.
{x
Cyriclasn'bael chuckled to himself. "Your master seeks the
Ancient Magic. I am not so newly awakened to not realize
this, little one." 
{x
With those words, the dragon lashed out with his long tail
to capture the small human within it. "Tell your Master
that his support is unnecessary and unwanted. And the
messenger superfluous."
{x
A smile cracked the great maw of the Beast, revealing the
dozens of razor sharp teeth and fangs.

Having wandered the lands of Alanthia for years after being stripped 
of his magick, the gargoyle, Crowley sought to regain his power any 
way he could. fought his way across the land of the three moons, 
warrior and dragoon, ever seeking that which had been taken - killing 
anything and anyone who got in his way. Slowly Crowley began his 
descent into the darkness of his soul. His mind was torn. So 
accustomed was he to the use of his almost god like magickal powers 
of the past. Now, there was nothing. He could still hear the laughter 
of the infernal Daedra as they tore his spirit from him and cast him
from his homeland. Crowley soon wearied of his work as a hired
sword. It was getting him nowhere closer to his goal of regaining
his lost powers. Therefore, he assumed the roles of more subtle
crafts, thievery and assassination. It was at this time in his
life he first heard the whispers of a great treasure to be found
called the Eye of Choronozon, which would bestow great powers
on its "finder". Madly Crowley sough his great and unnamable
treasure coming so close to finding it that he could feel the burn
of the magick within him again driving him ever onward. Just as he
felt his sanity slipping he heard a voice speak to him through the
mists of his power maddened dreams. It spoke almost inaudibly at
first. He could not make it out for it began in a strange and
long forgotten tongue; it made his skin crawl but the words slowly
began to come to him. It told him it sensed his hunger for the
elusive prize, but he could never achieve it in the state he was
for he lacked the peace of mind to make proper use of such an
artifact. Therefore he made a vow to the dark, twisted voice and
dedicated his life to serving Choronozon as a cleric. Upon making
this vow Crowley's eyes grew wide as the voice thrummed in his
head, more twisted and harsh sounding, and said " Hear now the
words from Oblivion, know that the universe is not as you have
seen it, nor as you shall ever see it again. Your eyes are shut
now to the illusory world you have known, for only thus shall you
see the truth around you. Only thus shall you see the horror that
awaits at the edge of time, at the edge of sanity, waits to devour
all that lives. You alone shall witness what waits in the cracks
between that which is"-and then he saw-saw the writhing things
teeming about him, wriggling in through the cracks in reality.
He felt a scream welling up into his throat. "And yet the world
as you know it still exists. It is your curse now to decide your
path, your destiny. To show others the Truth and the power or to
feed the Chaos. You will never see your world exactly as it was,
yet you shall have the power to move within it." With this
Crowley sank to his stony knees, put his head in his large, clawed
hands and accepted the price of power but ever remaining humble
to the Lord he served.

When Aragorn returned from his camping trip, and discovered what had
happened he flew into a quiet controlled rage. He marched at a rapid
pace just short of a run towards the throne room. Once he entered the
throne room he grabbed the sword of his father, Steel Bite, and cleanly
sliced off the head of the newly crowned king. On his way out of the
castle many guards, and servants tried to stop him, but men and women
alike tasted the cold steel of the famed sword as their life was cut
short. After the massacre of the household guard Aragorn went to see
his old teacher Rathis in Leeuwark. At the house of Rathis, Aragorn
told the story of what had happened with a few of his own twists to
make it seem like he was in the right. After finishing his story Aragorn
calmly demanded that Rathis create him a rift between worlds to send
him to another world to consolidate an army so that he could return and
conquer the Empire that was by rights his. Rathis conceded, and created
the rift which closed after Aragorn had stepped through. Little does
Aragorn know that the army that was sent after him by the Magistrate,
was finally reaching Leeuwark, and after they discovered that Aragorn
had been talking to Rathis they questioned him. Rathis would not tell
them where he had went, and so they had him promptly executed for
High Treason to the Crown. And so now Aragorn travels through the
world of Alanthia making friends of many a different sort in an effort
to get back to Tigeris and take over the only world he only really
knows, the world that is out of his reach for all times because, you see,
Rathis was the only one who knew where Aragorn had gone.

{x
Once on a world far far from this one there was a very powerful
king. He was the king of the great Empire of Tigeris. The people
of Tigeris were a hearty race descended from the ancient warriors
of which legends are made of. Being of a more brawn over brains
culture most of the people were warriors, or mercenaries that is
those of the True Blood that have come from an unbroken line
directly from those ancient warriors, although there were a few
who dabbled in the arts of magic with even fewer becoming masters
of the arcane arts.
{x
The King of Tigeris, Malanar, had a son during his 24th year as
king, and he named him Aragorn stating that it was a name of power
and authority. The king was nearing the age of 50 and thought it
wise to start in the training of his son as soon as possible so that
he could oversee how he was trained. The king was wise still in his
old age and thought it best that his son be trained in both the arcane
arts and combat skills. So at the age of three Aragorn was sent to a
remote part of the Empire that was along the disputed border, but had
a reputation for having one of the best magician's academies in the
Empire. With his first sword, a gift from his father, and orders not
to let him use it until he was seven years of age he set off in a
caravan towards Leeuwark. On the day of his seventh birthday Aragorn
didn't wake up as usual wi th the rooster. In fact he was having
fitful dreams in which he was finally starting to grasp the concept
of magic which he had been struggling to comprehend under his teacher
the magician Rathis. At about eleven o'clock that morning a servant
who had been sent to find him saw him struggling and ran to get the
Rathis. Rathis saw what was going on with the boy and recognized it
at once as something every practitioner of magic goes through, the
Understanding , and knew that if woken during his dreams he could lose
his mind or all of his training he had ever understood in the first
place.
{x
Aragorn awoke from his sleep four days later with the realization and
understanding of all that had ever been taught to him of magic. After
he awoke Rathis insisted upon the Lord of Leeuwark that Aragorn be
made the court healer. The lord finally agreed and Aragorn had his
first title.
{x
Five years later, during a particularly bad raid by the neighboring
Kingdom of Deviliand, the Lord took an arrow slightly off the mark of
his heart. When summoned from the battle Aragorn was furious because
he was about to launch a counter-offensive which had to be launched
within a window of the next two hours, and would do better for Tigeris
the sooner it was launched. Also the attack depended heavily upon his
being able to provide magical support which he would not be able to do
if he used his strength to heal the Lord. And there it was that Aragorn
made his first steps towards the evil that now holds him firmly in an
iron-tight grasp. Aragorn went ahead with his counter-offensive, and
destroyed every one of the enemy raiders. After the battle he rushed
back to the castle, but was too late to heal the Lord. The body was
still warm, and the surgeons said they had lost him only a few minutes
earlier. After this Aragorn ruled the tiny province until he was
approaching the age of 17. Upon the eve of his 17th birthday he
received word that his father was of ill health and that magic could
only prolong his condemned condition for a few long months of suffering.
So Aragorn left the lands to his most trusted advisor and left to care
for his father as best he could. One month to the day after he arrived
in Arax, the Empire's capital, his father slipped on to the Isle of the
Dead on the only moon of that distant planet.
{x
Upon the death of his father Aragorn left the castle in the middle of
the night telling no one and went camping in the Highwood Forest. With
Aragorn the only heir to the throne the Court Magistrate went to setting
up the ceremony for the next day, and presuming that Aragorn had
heard, and therefore made no arrangements for him to be told. Once the
time came for the ceremony and Aragorn was no where to be found.
Court pages were sent to look for him, but none could find him. The
Empire demanded a King, so the Magistrate did the only thing he could,
and crowned the Duke of Arax King seeing as how the king had no other
relatives, and his wife was dead.

I can no longer fight this battle...It is ever present, a never-ending
struggle for life on both sides. One side battles for power, the
other to exterminate those that threaten. I have no place here...
{x
Slowly the paladin turned, the vicious wind blowing her jet-black 
hair about her face, and surveyed the battlefield. Dead and wounded 
were now lying in puddles of their own blood and entrails in what had 
once been a beautiful pasture. She glanced down at her blood stained
sword and armor, shuddering briefly a dizziness crept over her
entire body, and suddenly she dropped to her knees and silently
wept. She wept for her fallen comrades, for those that she had
killed, and for those that would be killed in the battles to come.
She wept until she had no tears left, and finally, exhausted from
battle and sorrow, the paladin collapsed.
{x
Weak...I am weak. Such sights have never bothered me before...
{x
Slowly dropping into sleep, the wonders of an exhausted slumber
worked their magic...Now it is years earlier, the paladin is no
more, standing in her place is an adolescent girl, no more than 13,
with a fair complexion, hair the color of night, and eyes of
crystal blue...
{x
'Go out and finish some chores now.' Her father had said to her.
Her mother nodded, and she knew that this was a discussion for
ears othe than hers. The man inside with her parents intrigued
her immensely, though. He appeared to be a lord of some sort,
with beautiful inscribed armor and a sword with a jeweled hilt.
He had a young face, which unfortunately was devoid of any
emotions, but handsome none the less, and long black hair, which
dropped in small ringlets to his shoulders. He was also
obviously a warrior, which added to the fascination that she had
with him. {/
She wandered to the side of the small house, pretending to do
some worthwhile work, eavesdropping at the first open window
as she passed by. At first she could hear only muffled
conversation, but from the tone she knew it was not good. A
few fleeting words caught her ear, something about 'armies
amassing' and 'destruction if not obeyed', but this was standard
talk for every fool looking to gain a little power. As she
approached the second window, she bumped into something that
she could not see, and went face first into the ground. Looking
around, nothing could be seen, and so she blamed it merely upon
the clumsiness of her age. Nothing could be heard from the
second window, so the girl walked away from the house
grabbing an empty bucket and heading towards the wooded
area where the stream was that they got their water from.
{x
As she knelt at the stream to fill the bucket, muffled yells came
from the house, and she heard the door burst open and then slam
shut. She heard the strange man yell 'Cyrus! Destroy everything!'
He said something very strange and pointed at the door, which
her father was, by the sound of things, trying extremely hard to
open. The warrior then drew his sword and began to run toward
the forest. He was no longer a man...His, or better yet its,
face was contorted and twisted, its body a mass of oozing sores
and burned flesh. She knew she should stand up, she knew she
should run, but she could not move. She looked past the
demonic being and saw a huge green dragon slowly materialize
where she had been walking only moments before. It slowly
flapped its huge wings blowing dirt and leaves everywhere.
Hovering just above the ground, the beast drew back its tail
readying it to deal out a massive blow.

A greater fear than the dragon itself overtook her. They meant
to kill her parents and destroy everything they owned! Her
parents, mere farmers but influential citizens of their small
peasant village, were about to die horribly at the hands of the
monstrous beast. She forced herself up, but was quickly pinned
down by the huge demon that had spoken with her parents. The
dragon appeared to reconsider his course of action, and ever so
gracefully let his tail float behind him. He then forcefully
ripped parts of the roof off of the small house, gazing at the
two humans cowering in fear inside. He grinned and began an
intake of breath. The girl tried to turn away and close her
eyes, but the hideous beast holding her uttered a few words and
she felt herself unable to pull her gaze from the scene
unfolding in front of her and unable to move. 'You will
watch,' the beast wailed, 'so that you may tell others what
happens to those that defy us!'
{x
Snapping out of the horrible dream, the paladin frantically
looked around at unknown surroundings. Slowly recognition came,
and she realized that she was no longer on the battlefield, but
back in her room. She had been bathed, and her hair brushed out.
The priests must have found her and brought her back from the
field. She shuddered at the all too real nightmare that had just
been re-enacted.Revenge...I was not fighting to further good,
merely to kill those that had taken my family...
{x
Trying desperately to think of what this realization may mean
to her and those who relied upon her, the young paladin found
herself unable to form any coherent thoughts in her exhaustion.
Taking a drink from a glass of water that was on the table beside
her bed, she slowly allowed herself to drift back to sleep,
satisfied the horrible dream, which had been a reality of her
earlier years, would not continue. This matter would have to
be resolved after resting.
{x
A second slumber also worked its magic, bringing forth a beautiful
light that bathed the young paladin, and filled her body with a
faint warmth. In the light appeared a young maiden, she could
see but her outline, yet she knew that the maiden was of a
beauty beyond words. Softly, the maiden spoke...
{x
It was not weakness striking you out on the battlefield, my
child, merely enlightenment. You have realized the error of
your ways. You have been fighting for good, but in reality you
were fighting viciously for revenge. However, you have come to
the realization of this and its error, and that is why I have
come to you...
{x
The paladin began to speak, but she could not find the words.
She wanted to tell the maiden that she had thought she was
doing right, that she thought she was pursuing a higher and
better cause for all, and yet no words would come to her. She
thought she could see the maiden smile at this.
{x
It is alright child, do not try to speak, I know that your
heart is pure and true. Now that you have realized the path
you must take, I can be with you. Walk this path without fear,
aid those that you may, and fear not that which I may reveal to
you.
{x
Just as your ways have and will be changed, you yourself have
changed. The light of truth in which you have been bathed has
altered you, only slightly mind you, whereas you had a true
heart but fought for the wrong reasons. Your hair is changed
from the color of the night to the honey colored light of the
day, and your eyes have gone from the color of unfeeling crystal
to that of the lush and green earth. Hope shall be your cause,
and you shall bring this light to the land, instilling this
hope for the better in all beings of all causes...We are not
here to judge, merely to aid those in need.
{x
Wake now and follow my path...
{x
'There is darkness, everlasting darkness, I cannot wake, I cannot
move...'
{x
Come, Ambrosia, arise. You are needed and the land awaits...

"Here but now they're gone
Together in eternity...
Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew then disappeared
The curtains flew then he appeared...saying don't be afraid
Come on baby...and she had no fear
And she ran to him...then they started to fly
They looked backward and said goodbye...she had become like they are
She had taken his hand...she had become like they are"

{x    Darkness swelled within the open tomb of Al'kira, liches circling the 
coffin and chanting for the return of their long dead master. "Arise, 
Arise, ARISE." Slowly the body lifted toward the sky and glowed a deathly 
red hue. The corpse opened his eyes. His muscles tensed with the new power
of immortality and the thirst for blood.

Come with me into the willow garden out tonight.
Feel the darkness come my moon will touch you with its light.

Help me life was over love I want to had you in my sights.
See and I was overlooked I had you in my hands.
Like a lid of no survivors nothing I don't mind.
Help me broken baby help me break you with my mind."

{x
{x    Born and raised on a farm in the outskirts of the city of Thalos, 
baptised inside the female clan of Virago, taking the oath I would someday 
be inducted into their clan code. I was plagued with the hellish dreams of
an uncertain future. The nightmares as I call them, consisted out of 
slaughtering of villages, destruction of clans and corruption of power, 
without any doubt it must have given by Nikos, at least that was what I
believed at the time.
{x
{x    When I was older, I offered my services to a landlord, to work the 
field in exchange for pay and food and shelter. I enjoyed the aggreement 
for some time, till I heard the animals in the barn making a lot of noise,
I got out of bed and went outside to see what was making the animals the 
way they acted, but I could find nothing. When I went back inside I 
discovered the bloodless corpse of my master and several vampires feeding 
from the rest of the servants. They turned to me, with lustfull eyes, 
seeing me as yet another prey, till one of them suddenly turned around and 
snarls at the others, backing them off. I suddenly recognized the vampire, 
it was my own brother, since long lost and now I find him here, as a 
bloodthirsty vampire. He took me apart from the other vampires and 
explained how had luck had run out when he took shelter in a cave. He then 
offered immortality to me, or death like my landlord. Taking the only 
option given I turned towards my brother and offered him my life, to be 
thrown into eternal damnation.
{x
{x    My first few years as vampire were fragile, learning everything step 
by step, I found out soon that the light of the sun had severe effects on 
my body, always covering myself in black clads and cloaks. Feeding of 
small rodents and beasts I survived, till I stumbled onto a small temple 
in the dense jungle near the war mountains. Here I found the graves of
several men and one women, as I entered temple, I heard the door close 
behind me. Ghosts, from the graves I just saw, were swirming around me. 
They said they had been expecting my arrival, and the had been prepared 
for hundreds of years to train me, and train me they did. Spending several 
months within the temple, training my skills and sharpening my mind 
through meditation, I learned to control my body as well as my mind in
harmony. They also explained the dreams I have had since I was a child. 
Forecasting the desctruction of Tempest and the downfall of Legions.
{x
    In the following years I have talked to my brother Zastull about the 
matters that occupied us, the rise of a new clan and about our battles 
against it. Finding love and losing is as fast as I found it, leaving me 
cold and harsh, untill I found true love. I saw the breakdown of Virago 
leaving me untied, except to my dearest Briana, she who fills my heart
with joy.

{x
{x     Not knowing my past is one of the hardest things I have ever had to 
endure. I know nothing of my family, my heritage, or former self. The few 
things I have remembered from my past are vague and may not even be the 
truth, perhaps only what I want to remember, what I want to believe. I 
know not where my history began but I can vaguely remember a grand forest,
my home and the only place I felt safe. I learned from a vagrant once, 
that the place I believed to be my home was destroyed hundreds of years 
ago, but I can feel the spirit of the place, I know I am related to that 
earth. I have no idea who my parents were, what they believed in or look 
like, I can only imagine how they would look if I stood in front of them.
I hope they would be proud of my accomplishments, my hope, goals, and 
dreams. Hope is the only thing I have through which to remember them.
{x
{x    The part of my life that I do know started about 2 years ago. I can 
remember taking care of myself and raising myself but not knowing where I
learned how, or how I got where I am. When I realized that I existed I 
knew I had to find my history, I had to learn who I am. I've spent the 
last 2 years searching for some reason for my existence, some proof that
I am who I am. The only realizations I have ever had of that history is
short flashbacks of brief images and visions of people I know nothing 
about. I recently discovered others in Alanthia knew of my existence. I 
spoke with Torres IronCross and he told me that I had been in the 
Alanthian realm before. My memories are slowly coming back to me now. My 
form has changed, I was never always a dragon, but what I was I do not 
know. I also can't remember any profession or following. I'm starting to 
believe that my becoming a mage at my "mental rebirth" has something to 
do with my apparent absence from the realm. The reasons for the leave I 
took may be too dark and so lost I may never again regain the truth.
{x
{x    Today I had a vision. It was vague and I only recall bits and pieces 
of what I saw. I remember seeing my home, but no family or friends, only 
strangers. From where I was I saw a huge bird and lion-like creature 
attacking people and destroying what we had worked so hard to create. I
recollect the survivors, me included, standing in horror at what was left 
of our forest. The next few days were worse than any hell I can imagine. 
Everyone had to search for their loved ones, usually finding only a 
corpse or scattered remains. Memories were destroyed and the peoples' 
reasons for living were utterly crushed. After the initial attack, more 
than half of the survivors passed by their own hands. It was like a chain 
reaction. Someone would lose their grip on life, end their sadness, and 
create more sadness. To stop the sadness, I was given the disgraced name
GryphonX, to appease the creature, and cast away. I was never to see my 
home again. I was to bear the weight and sadness that the whole community 
felt. I was their solution; I was never asked, never consulted with. 
Maybe now I don't want to know who I am, or why and how I am. I can see 
know why I might have forgotten my past, It was my will.
{x
{x    Some visions last longer than others, but most are short and leave me 
feeling more confused than I was to start with. Every day I search for 
someone who can help me sort through all these thoughts and ideas, but 
have not yet found any such help. I am just now forming beliefs about how 
I feel, because it is so hard to know how you feel without knowing who you
are. Recently I have decided to start from here. I am GryphonX, I am 
myself, no matter how lonesome I feel, I know I will always be there for 
myself. I know my physical self, 5'11", a small yet fierce dragon, a blue 
dragon mage with the heart and freedom of the most powerful of the 
gryphons. I may never know who I was but I know who I am now. I am a 
visionary, wanting to enlighten the world through let my talents go to 
waste, I must use them to my best ability and through channeling my 
talents to help others, perhaps I might discover my former self and
further the being I have become.

{x        
{x         "My dear friend, Garrick, it has been so long! I hope 
{x         you haven't forgotten me, so please feel free to stop 
{x         by some time. We'll sit out back by that apple tree, and 
{x         it'll be like old times.
{x                                Signed
{x                                   Johnny"
{x
{x    In his one window cell, perhaps a bit roomy by normal standards with 
enough room for a bed, writing table, and fireplace, and a small window 
set into the wall, Garrick pondered the letter that arrived just this 
morning. The single candle of his room gave just enough light to read 
and write by, but it was still barely adequate. With a frown on his brow, 
he lowered the crackling parchment and set it aside. Some of his earliest 
memories had been of his friend Johnny..but unforunately, not very "fond" 
memories. Johnny had been an old friend of Garrick's, true, and even a
business partner in their...trade. By mentioning the "apple tree," and 
"old times" he must be talking about their old shop, perhaps going back 
into business. This was rather disturbing news, since Garrick had seen his 
friend's body when he had died. A little known fact was that Garrick had 
not always been a religious man, and if anything, his origins were of..
dubious nature, at best. He had been working very hard for the last 10 
years to bury that past, but it seems that many things were coming back 
to haunt him.
{x
{x    I was a thief once. Nothing but a petty thief. The memories of his 
violent ways, of his useless skills, came back to him with striking 
clarity, reminding him that it really wasn't that long ago. He had stole 
from the rich, stole from the poor, had even used his natural charm and 
grace steal some hearts as well (though if a couple rings fell in the bag 
along with those hearts, so what?). He had done quite well in fact, but 
always lost it somehow, and had to steal again.
{x
{x    It wasn't until that horrible day that he returned to his home town 
that he found most of it..well..gone. Almost nothing but a smoking crater 
was left. Nothing... the town..destroyed..dark stains everywhere...so much
blood..so much..He frantically slammed the door to those memories and 
shuddered, still feeling unclean. It had been during those great wars, 
when the powerful demi-gods, still barely mortal, had ravaged the world 
and whole cities had dissappeared at an angry gesture.
{x
{x    He no longer remembered where the town was on any map, or even how old
he had been when he fled from that place, screaming, mostly insane and 
gibbering. He had felt crushed, destroyed, as if a hole the size of 
mountain had replaced his soul. He remembered vaguely of stumbling into 
a church, or perhaps a monastry, where the monks had cared for him and 
eased his pain.
{x
{x    So much lost..and yet, so much gained as well, he thought. He had 
entered that place a madman..and had come out a holy man..well, a cleric 
anyways. Even if he was not devote as some of the monks, he still served
the gods and goddesses as they asked him to.
{x
{x    He blinked, returning to the present, and looked down absently at the 
letter. Pursing his lips, he lifted the note, and deliberately thrust its 
end into the flame of the lighted candle. That part of me is dead now, he 
thought, Gone with that town. Only Garrick the Cleric remains. Rising, he 
dropped the already-burning letter into the cold hearth of the fireplace. 
The firelight danced in his eyes as he watched the paper blacken and 
crisp. Only Garrick remains.

{x
As an infant Snitch was struck with a mysterious illness that kept his
blood running hot and kept the poor babe wailing throughout both day
and night. Frustrated, the parents finally called upon the local healer
to help their ailing child. They had acted too late for the disease had
already curled about the infant's mind infecting it - changing it.
{x
As a child, Snitch was prone to mad hallucinations in which he thought
himself a master mage, often shouting out nonsensical curses to those
nearby, playmates as well as adults. He often scared those about him
and most learned to keep their children away.
{x
As the young elf grew in years the hallucinations grew in number and
ferocity. Barely into his adolescent years, Snitch was cast out, his
family forced by the other villagers to condemn him.
{x
Having been given a large backpack full of provisions from his family
so that he would not starve, Snitch wandered alone for a long stretch
of time. One autumn day he happened upon a man crouched in the woods
amongst a patch of wild mushrooms. Another hallucination struck.  The
old man, a wizard who was gathering some ingredients and components at
the time, recognized some words of magic spilling from the young elf's
lips and looked up in surprise.
{x
The lad was clearly unstable, but the old man decided to train him,
seeing a source of great power within. The wizard took Snitch to his
abode and began to teach him. But Snitch could not learn the proper
discipline required to become a mage, and his hallucinations grew
steadily worse, not better as the old man had assumed.
{x
One night, during Snitch's greatest mad fit, his words slew the wizard
where he slept, the elf's plague-inspired mad gibberish calling down a
bolt of lightning that incinerated the old man and set the house
ablaze. More words spilled forth as Snitch half consciously groped for
the exit, his skin darkening under their power, his mind further
falling into their power.
{x
Snitch staggered outside of the burning home, and fell to his face
while still murmuring mad words. His eyelids fell as did hisconsciousness.
Snitch awoke hours later. The house was a smoldering ruin. His skin was
as pitch as night. Snitch's mind reasoned that he was a dark elf and as
far as his mind allowed him to remember, he had always been one. His
eyes alive with the fire that destroyed both master and home, Snitch
struck out, ready to face the world.

{x
When the last word fell heavily from the stranger's lips, Skull
stood and strode from the room. Impossible.... Violence. War.
Bloodshed. These were not words used to describe the cleric, or so
he had believed up until this moment. A fable, a story from
another land - another world - that's what the scroll was. But no...
somehow the words had been true.
{x
Skull sought comfort and solace in the great forest of Alanthia
in which stood the brotherhood's monastery. He struck off by
himself, his feet falling where they may. In his aimless wandering,
Skull eventually happened upon a clearing in the forest, the clearing
where he had been found, the clearing that had since never been
seen again despite long hours of searching.
{x
The matters of the day rested like a heavy backpack upon the
cleric's shoulders. Much had been revealed to the man, and he
needed time to muddle it all out. Appropriately enough, Skull found
the tree against which he was discovered, and sat in the same
spot in which he awoke years ago.
{x
Sitting in reverie, Skull let his eyes close and drifted back to his
first memories.
{x
{G                      ************************{x
{x
Waking with a start, Skull's first action was to confirm the
presence of a sword by his side, but what slight movements he
could muster sent wracking pains through his body. He moaned in
shocking pain, half-delirious to the point that he had not felt the
gentle touch to his face until the woman spoke.
{x
"Rest, rest. Do not try to move." Her hand drifted to his chest and
Skull felt the healing powers within her fingertips. But suddenly
the hand was gone and Skull was left alone against the tree,
recovering from some ailment or wound unseen by his eyes.
{x
Of how much time past, Skull was unsure. He sat watching the
treetops, the clearing, the sky. After what seemed an eternity,
he heard a voice hail him. Out of the woods and into the clearing
came a tall man dressed in the simple gray robes of a cleric. Skull
could not speak, his every attempt seizing him in agony.
{x
The man, seeing Skull's predicament, dashed off through the trees
and soon returned with a few more clerics who set about easing
the pain-filled man. When he had recovered sufficiently to walk
half-dazed, the clerics carried him to their monastery, offering aid
and shelter to the hapless man.
{x
During the weeks of recuperation, Skull learned much of the order
and asked to join them for he had no recollection of who he was
or where he had come from. The only thing he had remembered
was that his name was Skull, an odd name for a man. With the
brothers' help, Skull tried in vain to recover his lost memories, but
they proved too elusive.
{x
{G                  *********************************{x
{x
She had returned. Dressed in a simple white gown with lace
flowers interwoven into the hem and bodice, the woman was as
elegant as any Skull had ever seen. Her long auburn hair flowed
past her shoulders and her face reflected nothing but happiness
and love. Somehow Skull knew this woman... yes it was she who
had brought him to this world somehow. If only he could
remember.
{x
She bent down next to him, and sat alongside him. "You wonder
who I am, do you not?" she asked rhetorically. "Yes, Skull, I have
brought you into this world, a second chance at life if you will.
It was I who penned the scroll and I who read it. I am the one who
lead you back here, to my home in the wood."
{x
Skull thought nothing as he listened, save for the fact that she was
the key to his past.
{x
"Skull, you were once a great and evil man, tainted by a lust few
dare possess. You and your legions ravaged Aloria and destroyed
it, forever removing it from Life. And yet I was called to save
you from your own diseased fate, to bring you into a new world...
a new life to pay penance for the last."
{x
"You are destined to wander these lands, aiding those in peril,
comforting those in need. You yet have the mark of the warrior
upon you, yet you are a cleric in this lifetime, a holy man, good
and pure."
{x
"But...who are you, milady?" Skull ventured.

  "Hail brother Skull," the cleric smiled, the name catching in 
his teeth as it did years before when he had first spoken it. The
name just wasn't normal, especially for a brother.
{x
"Well met, Brother Gregory," Skull replied with a smirk as he entered
the cloistered meeting room. Virtually every brother in the order was
present, even those formerly away on secluded sabbaticals. Nods and
cautious smiles met Skull's eyes as he looked about the room.
Only one man was a stranger to Skull, seated near the head of
the large table around which all of the religious men sat. Brother
Gregory, the order's leader if there really was one, sat at the
far end of the table, directly across from Skull.
{x
Gregory motioned for Skull to sit in the only vacant chair. Once
Skull took his seat, the elder brother proceeded: "No doubt you
are curious as to the identity of the man to my right." The stranger
sat with his head bowed, his eyes locked upon a scroll held
between his slightly trembling hands. "And no doubt you are
curious as to the nature of the meeting which I have called."
{x
Gregory paused and Skull felt a thunderous clap of trepidation
strike him from above. Skull tensed and set himself on guard. He
looked about warily. Something was not right within the room.
Everyone's eyes were focused upon the stranger.
{x
"Skull...brothers, this traveler is known to us as Geraud. He hails
from a distant land, but carries with him a scroll of great import.
A scroll that concerns you, brother Skull." Gregory cleared his
throat and let the moment fill with uneasy tension. "Skull, your past
is as unknown to us as is the great journey of life into death. With
the scroll, Geraud may have the key that may unlock the riddle
that is your past." Geraud did not acknowledge anyone as he
simply unfurled the scroll and began to read.
{x
{G                 ********************************{x          
{x
The piercing thrust sliced into the man's midsection and the sword's 
tip emerged from his leather-clad back. Coughing out sinuous strands 
of crimson blood and clutching at the length of forged steel protruding
from his gut, the man fell to the ground, dead. The warrior god 
wrenched his sword from the twitching corpse and swung it quickly in
a precise arc, cleaving another man neatly in two. The carnage about
the frenzied god grew: bodies lie mutilated in crimson heaps of 
war-torn flesh all about the battlefield. With a vicious roar of
sickening laughter aimed at the very heavens, the warrior god strode
forth, his armies feeding upon the bloodshed left in his wake.
{x
He was tall, thin with war and hungry for death. His hair was coal 
black, long past his shoulders, matted with blood. His eyes were 
chaotic and insane, all colors having faded to a sinister gray. He 
wore no proper armor, yet no sword could be said to have ever bitten 
into his flesh. He wielded a mighty claymore, long and dark with
licks of obsidian flame dancing upon its blade.
{x
The warrior spotted the keep on the horizon, past rolling hills and 
an enormously deep valley no doubt filled with scores of defenders 
armed to the fullest. Amongst the protectors the heroes of Aloria 
would surely stand, each one famous in his or her own right 
throughout the land. The warrior god faced uncountable forces, but he
still held the upper hand: he could not die.
{x
He had been a warrior-king ever since he could ride upon a saddled 
horse, slaying his father while out on his first hunting lesson. He 
had raised an army at an early age and struck out against the many
kingdoms, trampling each under his heavy boot. After years of 
violent war, the remaining lords of the realm cried out to their 
gods as the warrior's force grew unstoppable. Something had to be 
done before everyone perished.
{x
The assembled gods, believing the warrior to desire power and 
immortality, granted him such. The gifts they bestowed upon him 
only succeeded in driving him further into the war-madness that 
corrupted his soul, for the warrior lived solely for battle, only 
for the death that he could administer.
{x
And now the warrior god led his horde into the only battle yet to 
be waged, the final battle of Aloria.

{x      -Isaac Watts, Divine and Moral Songs for children
{x
 Formerly a young half-elf, she was born in a land far from her 
present home in the realms of Alanthia, in a humble place known 
as Asgard. There she lived peacefully with her human father and 
her beloved younger sister Silu. Upon coming of age, she left her
family in search of a place to further her studies in the art of 
healing. Kindly  gnomes in a remote village directed her to a 
temple. There, she earned the class of a cleric and became 
acquainted with a presence she had sensed since her early childhood,
the gentle Goddess Ilya.
{x
Shortly after becoming a cleric, a halfling monk who taught her 
wanted her to himself. She objected to these feelings
but she felt obligated to him and so did wed him. One day,
out of the blue he asked her if she loved him. Being honest,
Lilu said she didn't and she never had. He was so infuriated
that he cursed her to never be able to feel loved or needed.
This curse swiftly took effect because she was a weak frail
creature and hadn't learned yet how to defend herself. Lilu
lived out her days healing and helping others but soon realized
something was missing... she became so sad and lonely that she
felt there was no reason to live. She seeked out a bridge and
threw herself off of it... she made no attempt to stay above
the surface.
{x
Now she is a walking spectre with a lost look about her. She
is a mystery to most other wraiths because they can still see
an innocence about her that is uncommon among them. Most
mortals feel sorry for her until they see... her eyes. They
reflect an understanding of life and the world that they will
never possibly understand. They then realize it is HER who
pities them. She pities them for being so weak to their human
(or human-like) emotions... or maybe it's jealousy. Also...
there is something else that glimmers faintly in her eyes.
Something that goes along with the wisdom and knowledge that
few ghosts know of... that something is fear.

{x
{x    Her childhood had been a quiet and lonely one, with only the forest 
and her family as companions, but what grand companions they were. 
Shoshara and Rhiannanon were the best of friends until they were separated. 
When she reached 10 cycles of age, the forest reclaimed it's own and 
spirited Shoshara away to the holy grove to be taught the holy ways of the 
gods and spirits. She learned well and quickly, reaching the end of her 
training in only 7 years. Upon her dismissal from tutelage, she remained 
in the forest, longing to reunite with her mother and sister. Eventually 
she resolved to leave the forest to which she had grown so attached and 
joined the ranks of main-stream Alanthian society. She had even held 
high-rank as a leader of Selohaar and was a respected healer and leader 
through her quiet strength and wisdom. But still, she felt unfulfilled 
and incomplete. Some essential part of her was missing, something she had 
in her forest home. She thought back to her teachings and her birth and
resolved to return to the grove where she learned her calling. The spirits 
she had always loved and worshiped would guide her, for they had guided her 
through all her life and work and would not fail her now.
{x
{C                    ____________________________{x
{x
{x    Shoshara closed her eyes and whispered words of meditation and prayer. 
When she opened them, she saw the sun-rays twist and change to grow into a 
giant tree, and then morph into a translucent emerald humanoid shape, 
beautiful and nymph-like in appearance. Shoshara dropped to her knees and 
cried "Why am I here? What is my purpose? What were those seven years of 
learning for? Help me, forest, Sahma!"
{x
{x    The spirit extended a transparnet palm and touched Shoshara's 
brilliant red hair tenderly. She whispered in a soft melodic voice, 
"Because of your work and love for the forest, you have been gifted, 
Shoshara, gifted with immortality. Keep the forest in your heart and 
preserve it with your new power. Go, join the others in the immortal realm
of Alanthia. Join your sister, Rhiannanon."
{x
{x    Shoshara gasped in disbelief as the figure slowly faded into the 
sunlight and disappeared. She muttered a quick prayer for transportation 
and disappeared into the immortal realm, where she remet her sister, the
priestess of the sky. The two were mirror images of each other in beauty 
and mystery- one cloaked in velvet green echoing of distant forests and 
the other in pure blue reflecting the beauty and power of the sky and air.

{x    Rain poured down in a heavy, piercing blanket that cut and tore the 
forest.  Loud claps of thunder echoed a low growl through the trees and 
brilliant  flashes of lighting flashed and faded, plunging the forest into 
hollow  darkness. In the split seconds of light, one could see two small 
shadows  darting hastily for cover. The shadows turned and caught sight of 
a hollow just large enough for both of them nested within a gnarled,  
ancient tree. One figure hoisted the smaller into the knot, where she 
collapsed, exhausted and ill. The larger figure lagged behind...peering
intently and searching. The female, in the tree, fell into a fevered and 
hasty slumber.
{x
{x    A blinding, burning explosion of heat and light caused the skin on the 
female to prickle. She awoke alert and looked hastily for her mate. 
Seconds later, a loud, ominous crash echoing with the sound of the instant 
shattering of bones and bark filled the forest. Within moments, a 
horrifying scream broke loose and a potent burning odor followed, sending 
the forest into chill shock. The female froze, horrified.
{x
{x    The storm broke suddenly, leaving only a heavy rain that echoed the 
female's mournful cries.
{x
{C                    ____________________________{x
{x
{x    Soft light filtered into the sylvan female's small haven. She awoke, 
her pale face stained with tears and her long auburn hair wet with rain 
and sobbing. She peered curiously out the hollow. Her vision was assailed 
with the sight of a scarred and injured forest. Soft rays of sunlight 
radiated through the canpoy. Her emerald green eyes gazed mournfully.
Under the broken and splintered remains of a tree she saw the torn and 
mutilated body of her mate. She turned from the ghastly scene in sorrowful 
resolution and fell asleep. Hours later, she awoke from her restless 
slumber, the pain in her heavy abdomen renewed. She sat up in sobbing pain. 
How could she go through child-birth alone? How would her child live 
without a father? She cried out in pain, her misery echoing through the 
empty forest. A soft scent of pine and greens suddenly permeated her 
senses and lulled her into a peaceful sleep.
{x
{x    She dreamed of the spirits speaking to her. They spoke of her child... 
wait, her children. Two daughters. They told her each would follow holy
paths and each was destined to be of different elements. She felt calm and 
relaxed...The spirits would guide and care for her children. She awoke 
with two small pale bundles nestled in each arm. One was wrapped in an 
emerald leaf and the other in a blanket of the purest blue. She named the 
one in green Shoshara, and the other Rhiannanon.
{x
{C                    ____________________________{x
{x
{x    Shoshara dashed lightly through the emerald green forest. Streams of 
light radiated and casted heavenly glows on the forest floor. Shoshara 
inhaled the fresh crisp air and pine scent happily. She loved the forest, 
the trees and animals and plants, the fresh air, and the protection and 
shelter offered. She continued to run until she arrived at a circular 
grove of oaks and hemlocks. She said a brief prayer to the spirits and 
entered. She removed her velvet cloak and kneeled upon the grove floor. 
She took out several vials and flasks, took a small sip from each and 
oiled her pale hands and face with a few. She finished her preparations
and stared up toward the sun radiating down upon her. She began to pray 
and mediate to the spirits of her forest, and Sahma of Alanthia.

{x 
{x    Tymhestloedd, the only daughter of Ffrydiau, the great dragon mage, was 
heavy of heart. She was many ages old, and yet she and her mate, Nwyfre, 
had still not succeeded in bearing a child. Who then could she train in 
the magic of her ancestors? One night, while sobbing profusely, 
Tymhestloedd prayed to the goddess of magic, the mystical Sahma. She 
prayed for a daughter to train in Sahma's ways of magic, brought back to 
Alanthia by Aiden, the Devout. Her tears shimmered in the moonlight as 
they fell to the floor. They created a small reflecting pool close to 
Tymhestloedd's knees. Tymhestloedd was shocked when she glanced in the 
pool and instead of her own reflection, saw the image of herself when she
was but a youth. The young dragon in the reflecting pool blinked, and was 
gone. Tymhestloedd was puzzled, and thought it only to be a hallucination.
She curled up and went to sleep. The next morning, when she awoke, there 
lying next to her was a perfect newborn dragon. Praising Sahma and crying
with joy, Tymhestloedd gave her newborn the name Awyr-Caniadau, Skyesong.
{x
{x    Tymhestloedd taught me the magical ways of Sahma, what her mother, 
Ffrydiau, had taught her, and her mother before that. My father, Nwyfre, 
dissappeared when I was very small. I still had my mother to raise me, 
and teach me. I became quite an expert young mage, as my mother was an 
excellent teacher. Yet, my mother was very old, and even the greatest of 
mages cannot prevent death. Tymhestloedd died quietly in her sleep one 
warm summer night. I sadly and reverently cremated my mother's corpse, the
firelight reflecting in my tears as my mother's ashes rose into the sky. 
After the embers had completely faded, I went to my favorite place, the
base of a beautiful tree in the midst of the forest. I had always loved 
the forest. It was so peaceful, and restful. It was the perfect place to 
sit and think, or mourn. With a heavy sigh, I collapsed at the base of the 
tree.
{x
{x    "Oh, Sahma," I prayed, "what am I supposed to do now? My mother is no 
longer here to guide me, and I am alone."
{x
{x    Weeping softly to myself, I fell asleep and had a strange dream. I was
in a place of silver and crystal. It was like a maze of mirrors, lighted 
by a cool, bright light. The maze spoke to me, "Skyesong, you are not 
alone."
{x
{x    An orb of glass appeared in the air before me. In it, I saw the forest, 
and all the creatures in it. Then, two elves and a sprite were shown to me.
{x
{x    "The forest is your element, Skyesong. These three have been called to 
serve the gods forever. You have been called too."
{x
{x    The orb then showed places and creatures from all over Alanthia. There 
was a vampire mistress, a demon, a human, a black dragon, and a gargoyle.
{x
{x    "Outside the mortal realm, time has no meaning. According to mortal 
time, some of those you've seen have not been called yet, but they will
be. However, once one is immortal, matters such as this have no importance. 
Yes Skyesong, you will live forever, for you are immortal. Do not abuse 
the power I have given you, Skyesong, for it is a privilage. You must 
serve me and the other moons by using your powers to serve Alanthia. This 
is your calling."
{x
{x    When I awoke, I was no longer in that forest, yet there was still that 
tree. Within the base of that great tree was where I forged my lair, and 
to this day I serve Alanthia as the liason for the clans. With the powers
that Sahma gave me, I am able to help the mortals of Alanthia find 
fellowship and protection within the clans. I think that so far, I am 
fulfilling my calling.

{x 
{x    *pLOp* A tendril of opaque goo dropped onto the High Lady's prone 
body. She shuddered slightly turning onto her side. Slowly, the slime 
leaked from the ceiling onto her prone form. Eyes suddenly opened and she 
screamed. Or tried to. The goo quickly  covered her face and halted the 
vain attempt to alert the guard. She suffered agony as the slime melted 
her body. The next morning, everyone wondered why the Lady Drusilla seemed
so happy... the next week, everyone in the fortress was dead.
{x
{x    Exeter stepped into the tavern. Full of purpose, he approached a booth 
at the  rear. Eyes looked up in recognition. "So, I take it they are all 
dead?" a man asked. "Yes," Exeter replied. "Do you have my pay?" Another 
handed the  assassin a heavy pouch. He knew that every single cutpiece 
would be there.  Few did not pay his fee. Those that did were dead. Silently, 
he walked out of the tavern and made his way homeward. In his lair, he 
stared into a mirror. His 'face' began to run in amorphous streams revealing 
his true visage. That of a guileless, young man.
{x
A SCHOLAR'S NOTE
{x
{x    It is not known how many died at the assassin's hand. However, we do 
know that Exeter belongs to a breed of changlings capable of transforming 
into any form. I myself have never encountered any of these beings 
although Exeter alone substantiates their presence in Alanthia. Past 
studies by other scholars adhere to the belief that Exeter is a an ardent 
student of the Places in Between. Case studies reveal that he communes with 
spirits on a regular basis. It is in these same journals where we find 
that Exeter considers his actions neither good or evil. Simply serving the 
balance between order and chaos. The veil of time still obscures much we 
know of this secretive figure.

{x
{x    Long ago, a man named Roen lived alone by the sea. His was a dark and 
quiet life, filled with the gentle wash of the surf in the cove, the call 
of the seagull, the wind through his thatched roof. He was a man at peace 
with himself, and at war with forces unseen. He was haunted, chased by a 
demon most vile.
{x
{x    The demon's name was Grbrthrxs.
{x
{x    Roen was a mage, powerful beyond imagine. The land bent to his will, 
the lightning ate from his fingers. He was a creator, spending his life 
making the world around him better for those who came after.
{x
{x    He had, many years in the past, killed a Dark Knight in battle. The 
knight was a the half-human child of the demon Grbrthrxs. Since then, his 
nights had been filled with screams, his days filled with study, trying to 
find a way to defeat the agent of pure evil.
{x
{x    Every night, the demon would come forth and try to take over the 
mage's mind, to rip his soul from his body. Grbrthrxs hoped to enslave 
Roen's life's essence, and keep him witness while the demon destroyed the
land Roen so dearly loved.
{x
{x    While perusing tomes discovered deep in the library at Dre' Kesthai, he 
found this: 
{x
{x        "... a mage of true power, of pure heart, and of iron
{x          will may take over the body of another creature, and
{x           use that body for his own purposes. This good chance
{x         that, once switched, you will never be able to return.."
{x
{x    Roen formulated a plan. When the demon came, and attempted to take his 
body, he would be doing the same. He assumed that in the form of a demon, 
his power would be so immense that he could crush the will of Grbrthrxs, 
return to his own body, and destroy Grbrthrx's avatar.
{x
{x    He made the grueling preparations, and readied himself in the center 
of his protective runes. Grbrthrxs came to him, a huge black apparition,
burning with hell's fire. Roen recited the incantation just as Grbrthrx's 
huge black hands breached the protective circle...
{x
{x    ...and he watched, through his new eyes, as hands closed around his 
own throat, and the life drained from his body.
{x
{x    He had no body to return to. He felt nothing of the demon's presence, 
and his powers had increased a hundredfold.
{x
{x    Saddened, he vowed to spend his remaining days in seclusion, shaping 
the land around him.

{x  
{x   As a child, Torres lived in a quiet village in the mountains called
Gorge's Fall, with his family and his brother, Sevyr. Torres was
swayed into the divinity of the church while his brother took the
path of a mage.
{x
{x  At an early age of three years, Torres received
visions from the town's deity, Tamara. Some were peaceful, of
lush rolling meadows with children playing games, and some were
nightmarish, of burning houses and soldiers raping and executing
villagers. During intense visions Torres would fall to the ground
and convulse sporadically, his eyes rolling up in his head,
screaming in pain. His parents didn't know what to do. The
priests performed numerous exorcisms, thinking Torres was
possessed by demons, to no avail. As he grew older, the visions
became more frequent and extreme, from feeling in absolute
ecstasy to having violent, painful seizures. The priests and his
parents were baffled. They couldn't explain what was going on,
or why it happened, and felt very helpless.
{x
{x  One day, at fourteen years of age, while playing with a group
of his friends in a prairie, Torres dropped to the ground,
clutching his eyes and ears in agony, and banged his head hard
against a rock, barely retaining consciousness. Slowly his
moaning became soft and he saw himself surrounded by his
friends from a far away distance. His vision jerked to the
left suddenly and he saw a phalanx of soldiers marching towards
his town, flanked by rotting zombies and led by several mages.
Absolute fear flooded into his body as he awoke to find himself
laying in his bed, surrounded by his parents, brother, and a
priestess of the town. He bolted out of his bed and aimed
straight for the door, but his father grabbed him and laid him
on the bed. Torres babbled like a madman about his terrifying
vision, but his parents just stroked his head and said
everything will be ok. Torres became delirious, and fearing for
his safety, the priestess casted a calm and slumber spell over
him, and slowly Torres' babblings trickled down to soft murmurs,
then to slow breathing.
{x
{x  In his slumber, Tamara appeared to Torres, and revealed to him
a horrifying vision of his town being devastated at that very
moment. "Torres, I have given you these visions in hopes that
your priests may listen to you and save and rescue your town
and other towns, but they did not understand. You are my only
guardian left in this mortal plane. Awake, and flee your
homeland. All that you have lived and grown with will be no
more. Your family and friends will not live through this night. It is
beyond my powers to stop this holocaust. Fight your way out.
Run like the wind to a neighboring land and don't look back.
You are my only hope."
{x
{x  Tamara kissed Torres on the lips and suddenly his eyes fluttered
open, his hands grasping a hilt of Tamara's holy blade.
Billowing, black smoke stung his eyes, screams of death pierced
his ears, and overwhelming stench of burning bodies assaulted
his nose. Torres ran outside his house and tripped over his
father's mangled, bloodless corpse. Torres' body and face
pressed sickly against his mother's scattered flesh about the
ground. Torres looked up and saw a huge zombie strangling Sevyr
to death. He jumped to his feet and hacked off the zombies
legs and arms and freed Sevyr. Torres hoisted his brother's
comatose body onto his shoulder and fled his burning village.
No one gave chase to the boy, too engrossed in pillaging the
village, except for one mage. Sevyr weighed Torres down, and
by the time Torres put a safe distance between them and the
town he laid Sevyr down. Sevyr's hand turned a grotesque bright
green. Fearful of a disease spreading to vital organs, Torres
severed off his brother's hand and threw it in the woods. But
he acted too late. He knew Sevyr would die from disease before
they reached the next town. Torres feel to his knees and prayed.
The mage following Torres revealed himself and laughed at the
scene. "I will save your brother," the mage said and laughed
even harder at Torres' hopeful expression. The mage uttered
archaic words of sorcery and gestured at Sevyr. Sevyr's form
slowly transformed into a hideous, transparent wraith as he
opened his month and gave a silent scream. "And as for you,
weakling, you will always have evil by your side. You shall
remember this day's events, and Sevyr will remind you of

that for every day of your damned life!" He slapped Torres
across the face with his wand and disappeared.
{x
{x  Torres took Sevyr with him still, and for years he wandered
the lands and wept for his brother, family, friends, and
homeland. With everything he knew lost or destroyed, Torres
clung desperately to Tamara and her visions, the only source
of strength that kept him alive, and entered into a new land.

conclusion~
In conclusion, my theory is that the gods give us new bodies to benefit both
themselves and us.  I have also outlined some other general theories (about
the relation of mana and souls, the relation of bodies and souls, and how
gods receive energy).  Keep in mind, though, that this is all theory, and
that there is nothing (that I am aware of) that proves it entirely.  It is
merely logic. 

Thirst for knowledge as a vampire thirsts for blood  -Conteo
~
E
Physical regiving~
This is where we can begin to delve into the physical re-giving.  CeleDi,
Nikos, and Sahma are all very powerful considering that they are mere moon
gods.  Now, how is it that they became so powerful?  Perhaps they learned
from Kazimain.  Kazimain was a very generous god (she resurrected our world)
and she also received much energy when stars died.  This would suggest that
the mana favors gods with kind hearts (or at least with that illusion).  Now
what would be kinder than allowing souls to live instead of reaping their
energy?  So, when our bodies die, the gods create us new ones, at little or
no expense to themselves.  And, in passing the potential chance of getting
mana, they receive much more for their kindness.  
Also, not allowing soul-deaths can and has given the realm a bit of extra
prestige and fame.  Can you imagine how pitiful you would have been if your
life had ended the first time you died?  The system of physical re-giving
allows greater heroes to arise, as well as the evil that allows heroes to
exist.
Of course, dying is not recommended, which is why we undergo extreme pain
and lose general strength when we die.  After all, we would in functionality
be immortal if there were no disadvantages when we died.
~
E
relation mana souls~
On the other hand, there does seem to be a limited amount of mana in
the universe.  I believe that mana is a sort of life force.  My theory is
that, when organized, it can become magic (as utilized in spells) or souls. 
I refer to the soul as the carriage of life and self-consciousness. 
Self-consciousness is the true factor that sets us apart from machines; the
awareness of ones existence.  The soul is attached to its body, which makes
it more powerful and allows it to directly influence the physical world. 
The brain is the main connection between the two, and accounts for actual
intelligence and memory.  Without intervention by the gods, a soul dies
shortly after its body does.  When a soul dies, the mana divides itself
among the gods at its own discretion.  This is why we see from the legendary
story of our planet that when stars die, select Gods receive power; when a
star dies, its planets die, and when a planet dies, so do its inhabitants. 
And thus the souls.  The gods create new worlds and souls with the mana, and
so it is a constant cycle.  
~
E
concept unlimited power~
As any immortal could confirm, immortals can create as much of any
matter as they desire.  This would suggest that there is unlimited matter in
the universe, or at least that it undergoes cycles quickly enough that it
would be inconsequential.  Either way, it is obvious that there is no
shortage of physical material and never in eternity will be.  Therefore
there is no particular reason that the gods should have any qualms in giving
us new bodies when our old ones die.  
~
E
introduction~
The almost instant transportation from the state of the death to the
state of living consciousness has been loosely referred to as reincarnation
here in Alanthia.  However, it is not this phenomenon which occurs (by
definition).  One would consider the transportation of Skull from one realm
to another, his memories erased and warrior attitude changed, as closer to
the definition reincarnation.  We, on the other hand, do not experience any
changes other than a decrease in our overall might, and there are no easily
evident reasons for this phenomenon.  Why and how, then, does this happen to
every living creature in the realm of Alanthia, and why doesnt it happen in
all realms?  I have done extensive research on these subjects and the
purpose of this essay is to discuss them in detail.  
Throughout the rest of this discussion I will refer to the process we
undergo immediately after death as a physical re-giving by the gods, the
receiving of a copy of ones body.

corrosive fang~
During the Quest to prove themselves to their Gods, Romana's members went
on a journey to slay the dreaded Black Dragon.  They removed all the teeth
from the Dragon which was many, for the Dragon was large, and brought it
back to the Gods.  The Gods have found their followers worthy, and have
given Romana the teeth of the Dragon.  Sharpened and hoed to perfection by
their Blacksmith, this corrosive fang is fatal to the wielder's opponent.

sphere~
Upon closer examination, the blue-green sphere reveals itself to be a
globe of Alanthia.  A large town, Midgaard, dominates the central part of
the sphere.  To the east lies a great sea bordered by the town of New
Thalos.  Several villages and caverns dot the landscape.  West of the city,
a great forest blankets the land.  Several rivers flow through the city,
feeding into the swampy land to the south.  The southern part of the globe
is covered in dark greens and mountains.  North of the town is great jagged
range of mountains, beyond which lies no one knows.  A large desert is
situated to the southeast and several islands litter the coast-lines.
